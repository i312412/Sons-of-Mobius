  SHADOW_TT:0 "§OSHADOW THE HEDGEHOG§!\n§RTHE ULTIMATE LIFE FORM§! \n\n§GHealth Points§!: §C[?shadow_health]§!\n§YDominant Ability§!: §CSpeed§! \n\n§RShadow the Hedgehog§! is the end result of §RProject: Shadow§!, an effort to create the Ultimate Lifeform. Created by §RProfessor Gerald Kintobor§! in his efforts to find a cure to a rare disease known as NIDS that was affecting his granddaughter §RMaria Kintobor§!, §RShadow§! was gifted with the powers of the alien Black Doom through that entity's blood. After the project was forcibly shut down by the government, §RShadow§! was put into stasis for 50 years and then awakened by §RDr. Eggman§!, Gerald's grandson, to help him take over the world. Shadow sought instead to destroy the world to avenge §RMaria§!, who had been killed by the raid on Space Colony ARK where they had both lived. However, he would later be persuaded by §CSonic the Hedgehog§! to help save the world, afterwards becoming a §Ghero§! who helped to save the planet on numerous occasions. \n\nAfter he joined §Rteam DARK§! and enlisted himself in §CG.U.N. ranks§!, he became another living weapon in hands of the government which intends to save the world from all the threats approaching the lives of innocents. §RShadow the Hedgehog§! is grim and self-contained, but he always finishes the missions he started. Obtained an ability to run on supersonic speeds and use Chaos attacks, he became a pure terror in eyes of his enemies."
  ROUGE_TT:0 "§OROUGE THE BAT§!\n§FTHE MIDNIGHT THIEF§!\n\n§GHealth Points§!: §C[?rouge_health]§!\n§YDominant Ability§!: §YThievery§! \n\nThe §FRouge's§! past is covered in mysteries, but they have not yet been solved for the reason that many people are not interested in them. This woman is a §Ftroublemaker§!. It is known that a short time after the end of the §RFirst Robotnik War§!, Rouge was recruited into the §CG.U.N.§! with her skills as a treasure plunderer and infiltrator on the home front. She served as a double agent for §REggman§! for a time, getting to know §RShadow the Hedgehog§! and unraveling many of his secrets, which influenced their future relationship. \n\nShe got her way by any means necessary, from infiltration and theft to flirting and interrogation. She often takes an unspoken leadership role on the §Rteam DARK§!, orchestrating operations in the field. She was also the liaison between the rest of the team. Her abilities and skills of close quarters combat, flight and thievery made her an ultimate spy which no one would wish to encounter as an enemy."

After being kept in storage for over a year, Omega was finally released with a mission to destroy the traitorous §GE-102 Gamma§!. Although successful in his mission, Gamma managed to reprogram Omega to grant him a "soul" before being destroyed. Following this and a conversation with §RShadow the Hedgehog§!, Omega decided to follow in his brother's footsteps and fight the §REggman Empire§R as an agent of the §CGuardian Units of the Nation§!, where he later became a member of §RTeam Dark§! along with §RShadow§! and §FRouge the Bat.§! \n\n§RE-123 "Omega"§! is believed to be the most powerful battle robot on Mobius, capable of destroying multiple military units alone. His arsenal is huge and can launch anything, even small nuclear missiles. He can cause fear even among his §CG.U.N. colleagues.§!"
