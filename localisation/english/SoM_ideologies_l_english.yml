purificationism_infinite_order_subtype_desc:0 "The so called 'Infinite Order' brand of Pruificationism is best defined by the three attributes valued by Jackalstan: 'Duty, Loyalty & Strength'. Infinite's ideology calls for the citizenry to give everything they have to the state, especially its military, without a moment of hesitation or dissent. This is largely achieved through a quite literal cult of personality surrounding the head of state. Being worshiped as an almost messianic figure, promising to deliver onto the people their greatest desires. The economy is heavily centralised and focused on funding the military and rapid expansionism, with a civilian economy being minimal, though still existant. Social structure is heavily regimented, with limited time granted for recreation and most of what is available being propaganda. However, Intellectual persuits surrounding the arts are encouraged, with little direct consorship, provided its not openly critical of the state. Though foreign media is mostly illegal, with few exceptions. The value of strength is emphasised in the ideology's view towards those without it. Children born with physical or intellectual disabilities are killed at birth, with screening technology to identify such defects being a highly valued area of technological advancement. The elderly are strongly encouraged to 'volunteer' for euthanasia, though if they are able to use their experiences to provide for the state, such as training military officers, this will not occur. Despite their purging of the disabled, those who are crippled by combat injuries are not euthanaised. In fact, they are culturally reveared and granted a healthy pension for they are seen as having proved their loyalty to the state through enduring such a crippling injury. Furthermore, views on sexuality and gender are strangely progressive. Though citizens are encouraged to start large families, homosexuals face no legal descrimination provided they continue to serve the state. And there are no restrictions on career choices for women, as long as they are capable of forfilling their duty. Bring new, strong and healthy children into the world is seen as one of the most important ways a woman can contribute to the state. As a result, Maternity leave and child support are granted to ensure the child is able to be raised properly, though child support ends once they reach the age of 16."
