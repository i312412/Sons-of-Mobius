RCR_leader_name:0 "YURIY PALLASOV"
RCR_leader_bio:0 "Yuriy Alexandrovich Lebedev was born to a hereditary officer and a university professor. Since childhood he was surrounded by the children of socialists, getting closer to them, studying the teachings of Heinrich Katzer, playing war games with them and unsuspecting that many of them would become his comrades after little more than ten years. Nevertheless, his father's grip led the would-be revolutionary into the army of the Rethenian Republic at the end of the Great War and the beginning of the First Robotnik war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_Pallasov_pic_2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n He caught the fall of his native country under the merciless onslaught of Robotnik, and he had to join forces with a large group of his compatriots as a platoon commander to wage guerrilla war against the invader. Thus, under the pseudonym of "Pallasov" he had become one of the commanders of the Rethenian Freedom Fighters, and under his command, the Red Guard of Freedom Fighters freed Stalegor from the pro-Robotnik regime. Soon after the country's liberation from the Robotnik Empire, Comrade Pallasov was one of the most influential persons in the country, leading the left-wing faction of the unstable coalition government. The Cold Hunger, the collapse of the industrial production, conflicts over land property and the subsequent collapse of the government led to civil war, which began as an aftermath the New Year Revolution, when Pallasov gave the Red Guards command to open fire on government troops who were trying to disperse the strike at the Arsenal plant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_Pallasov_pic_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      §gThis is when the Rethenian Council Socialist Republic was born.§! \n\nPallasov led the Red Army and government institutions of the Council Rethenia actively, often going on the battlefield and using his magnetic super abilities, which very soon exhausted his nervous system. Severe illness caught Pallasov soon after the defeat of the reactionary forces of Rethenia in 3233, forcing the chairman of the Sovnarkom to retreat from political life for two and a half years. Unfortunately, in his absence, there was a rift in the ruling RPRA party, and under conditions of intra-party conflicts no one could stop the disintegration processes in the local Councils. Now that Pallasov has returned from his treatment, he is ready to continue the struggle for the liberation of the workers of all Mobius.§!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

Shadow_leader_bio:0 "Leader. Radical. Immortal. These are words some would use to describe Shadow the Hedgehog, while none of these are wrong, it would also be incorrect to say they are right. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_Shadow_pic_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShadow was not born, instead he was grown on the Space Colony ARK as part of a Classified Military Project. Created by none other than the Grandfather of Doctor Eggman, Gerald Kintobor. He was made with dual purposes, the first was as a weapon of war and destruction to be used against GUN’s enemies. The other was to provide a cure for Neuro-Immuno Deficiency Syndrome, or NIDs, a progressive neurological disorder that afflicted Gerald’s Granddaughter, Maria. Upon being awakened, Shadow struck up a sibling-like bond with Maria and they were practically inseparable, even if he was unable to provide the Cure.\n\nSuch a life was short lived however. \n\nGUN raided the facility upon finding out Gerald was lying to them about the progress of the project as well as its purpose. Arresting or executing the research staff for treason. Shadow and Maria desperately tried to escape, but the young girl sacrificed her own life to save Shadow’s, ejecting him out of an escape pod. After a brief period of hiding, Shadow would eventually be captured and placed in stasis for 50 years. \n\nUpon being awoken, he aimed to fulfill Maria’s dying wish, which he misinterpreted as a desire for revenge. It was only through the selfless actions of Amy Rose that he was able to remember it was instead a desire for peace and harmony. With a new vigor for life, he sacrificed himself to prevent the ARK from crashing into Mobius. He went missing for six months, until he resurfaced while working alongside known thief Rouge the Bat and a Badnik defector known as E-123 Omega. Suffering from Amnesia, Shadow worked desperately to regain his memories, a quest he was unable to fulfill for years. \n\He would join GUN, becoming the leader of ‘Team Dark’, which consisted of himself, Rouge and Omega. He laid waste to armies, assassinated traitors and led great battles in the name of peace. Eventually he had enough. With his image of a hero amongst the people, the backing of parts of the military and one of the most experienced tactical minds in the world, Shadow was able to stage a local coup and take the first step in conquering the rest of the UF in order to establish a new regime in its place. \n\nWhat Shadow plans to do with this power is by far what most people are afraid of. To some, he is a hero and liberator, dedicated to creating a world free of war and hunger. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_Shadow_pic_2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo others he is a brutal militarist who wants nothing more than global conquest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
