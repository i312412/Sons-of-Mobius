###Rethenian CSR
POLITICS_RCR_PALLASOV_DESCRIPTION:0 "Yuriy Alexandrovich Lebedev was born to a hereditary officer and a university professor. Since childhood he was surrounded by the children of socialists, getting closer to them, studying the teachings of Heinrich Katzer, playing war games with them and unsuspecting that many of them would become his comrades after little more than ten years. Nevertheless, his father's grip led the would-be revolutionary into the army of the Rethenian Republic at the end of the Great War and the beginning of the First Robotnik war. He caught the fall of his native country under the merciless onslaught of Robotnik, and he had to join forces with a large group of his compatriots as a platoon commander to wage guerrilla war against the invader. Thus, under the pseudonym of "Pallasov" he had become one of the commanders of the Rethenian Freedom Fighters, and under his command, the Red Guard of Freedom Fighters freed Stalegor from the pro-Robotnik regime. Soon after the country's liberation from the Robotnik Empire, Comrade Pallasov was one of the most influential persons in the country, leading the left-wing faction of the unstable coalition government. The Cold Hunger, the collapse of the industrial production, conflicts over land property and the subsequent collapse of the government led to civil war, which began as an aftermath the New Year Revolution, when Pallasov gave the Red Guards command to open fire on government troops who were trying to disperse the strike at the Arsenal plant. This is when the Rethenian Council Socialist Republic was born. \n\nPallasov led the Red Army and government institutions of the Council Rethenia actively, often going on the battlefield and using his magnetic super abilities, which very soon exhausted his nervous system. Severe illness caught Pallasov soon after the defeat of the reactionary forces of Rethenia in 3233, forcing the chairman of the Sovnarkom to retreat from political life for two and a half years. Unfortunately, in his absence, there was a rift in the ruling RPRA party, and under conditions of intra-party conflicts no one could stop the disintegration processes in the local Councils. Now that Pallasov has returned from his treatment, he is ready to continue the struggle for the liberation of the workers of all Mobius."
POLITICS_Dobchinskiy_DESC:0 "Originally, the Southern Committee of RCSR was led by Ivan Belskiy, an ardent Katzerist and proponent of centralization. His directives had only one purpose: the destruction of counterrevolution and separatism in Rethenian CSR. \n\nBut his single-mindedness was his undoing: Belskiy’s subordinates revolted against their boss. The committee expelled Belskiy from the government. Belskiy was sentenced to be shot by a revolutionary tribunal. The list of his charges was long and contradictory. For example, he was charged both for sexual assaults on 16 years old girls and “passive homosexuality”. However, he wasn’t shot - instead, he was buried alive before the trial ended. \n\nHis execution was not left unpunished. A few months ago, Belskiy’s loyalists led by commissar Konstantin Dobchinskiy broke into the house of the Committee. All participants of Dobchinskiy’s trial were shot and the Committee has been renewed by KORTS subjects. \n\nDobchinskiy himself keeps in touch with Pallasov and Koliuchkin, supporting them and promising to submit his committee to the central government after the end of the VII Congress of Councils. Though, he would agree to join any central government. He is not a man of factionalism. He is a man of stability, a strong state, a security for the people and Revolutionary ideals."
POLITICS_POTEMKIN_DESCRIPTION:0 "Potemkin was as a sailor on the cruiser "Varvara", he was already known as a brawler who broke a cook’s nose for serving him smelly meat, and for such cases worked on the galley as a punishment. He joined the "Varvara" uprising of 3215 and soon became the leader of the uprising, throwing the captain overboard. Later, he was betrayed and handed over to the authorities by several comrades. Panteleimon was sentenced to death, but the outbreak of the Great War gave him the opportunity to volunteer for the deadly task of the crew of the cruiser "Martha". He conducted socialist agitation on board, but had little success at it.\n\nAt the beginning of the First Robotnik war, the cruiser was flooded and abandoned by its crew, unable to repel the attacks of Robotnik's naval forces. Potemkin and a few of his comrades were able to get to the cargo ship and sail to Vostokograd. Subsequently, he took part in the guerrilla war against Robotnik's troops, proving himself a brave daredevil. After the liberation of Stalegor he returned to his native city of Vostokograd only to catch an important event again - the socialist revolution, and the city was first captured by revolutionary forces. The head of the Vostokograd revolutionary committee died during the siege of the city, and Potemkin had to take over the leadership and wage guerilla warfare against the VRS forces. After reunification with the Red Army, he took part in the liberation of his home and was elected head of the entire Far Eastern Committee."
POLITICS_IRKATAN_DESCRIPTION:0 "Comrade Irkatan was born into a family of lawyers who were on the verge of ruin, but still able to pay for his son's education. At school, he became interested in socialist ideas and joined a large Katzerist society, which would later grow into a political movement and become part of the RPRA party. When Robotnik's troops entered Makarovsk, the city where Vladimir studied, Irkatan joined the Red Guard of Freedom Fighters and quickly went to active campaigning and guerilla warfare, and after the liberation of the country from Robotnik, he joined the RPRA, becoming Chairman of the Makarovsk Party Committee. Even then, having reached the administrative posts, Vladimir cleared the committee of nationalist and petty-bourgeois elements and formed new units of the Red Guard. Irkatan was one of those who in 3230, on the eve of the New Year's Revolution, called Pallasov and urged him to give directives to all units of the Red Guard as soon as possible for the beginning of the armed uprising, feeling that increasing activity of the reactionary forces would soon leave no chance for the victory of the Rethenian worker movement. His actions justified themselves, and although the first months of the war were not very successful for the Reds, the Country of Councils managed to mobilize resources and masses for victory, and Irkatan was one of the hundreds of organizers who built a strong rear and reliable defense. Irkatan, on the wave of his popularity because of his past merits, was elected Chairman of the Siverian Committee after the Civil War. During the period of bureaucratic and administrative chaos, Irkatan continues to believe that soon Rethenia will be rebuilt and continue its victorious march for the World Revolution."
POLITICS_SNEZHNIKOV_DESCRIPTION:0 "Alexandr Snezhnikov - a person with a challenging history. He was born in the Grand Duchy of Tuunimia in a family of Rethenian officers. The revolution and the proclamation of Tuunimia's independence took his family by surprise, but he could not leave it, because his father was an ardent monarchist and insisted that Sasha should not live in the revolutionary republican Rethenia. Subsequently, his father supported Mazhavov's coup and attached his son to an artillery school. Already in the last years of the Great War, Snezhnikov took part battles in Swartzland, and the remains of the Overlanders were driven out of the country. He fled to Rethenia after Robotnik occupied Swatzland and Tuunimya, but with several other officers he managed to take control over the Tuunimian Imperial Army Corps and escape to the Northern Rethenia. This campaign became known as the Northern March - on the cold tundra of the North, the army was able to reach the city of Krasnoroyevsk and meet the Red Guard of Freedom Fighters, seeing them as the only possible allies. The Tuunimian Corps provided substantial assistance to the Freedom Fighters, and Sasha managed to make friendship with Fyodor Shubin... Under unpleasant circumstances. \n\nThey were taken prisoners, both became victims of Evgeniy Gromov's experiments. Snezhnikov was given far less "honor" than comrade Shubin - Alexandr was maimed, his eye poked out, his lungs and one leg removed - all in order to replace it with robotic limbs and organs, reducing complete robotization to partial robotization, which will later be used in the process of Legionization. Shubin broke out and helped Sasha escape. Snezhnikov was increasingly disappointed in the principles he had lived by and became more sympathetic to socialism. Subsequently, he will lead the Northern Front of the Red Army of Rethenia, and after the salvation of the Council Rethenia he was elected head of the Northern Committee as a proven disciplined comrade."
POLITICS_Liushkin_DESC:0 "It was foolish of the Republican Rethenian government to leave such a mass of revolutionary-minded sailors there - on the territory that served as one of the key points of exile for unwanted politicians and revolutionaries. Cold and famine did their part, and when the banner of revolution was hoisted over the capital of Rethenia, the sailors of Mirkulovets started the rebellion, executing almost all officers and officials and put the new, socialist government in their place. It did not smell like Katzerism there. Anarchist sailors stood up “for everything good, against everything bad”. \n\nAnarchy, committee infighting and the "dictatorship of the fleet" retain their positions. Pavel Lyushkin, nicknamed "Papasha", comes from a family of small landowners. He rules this realm of revolutionary violence and freedom. And although the Committee begins to centralize power and change its policy to a more pro-Katzerist one, and Pashka claims his right to become the new head of Rethenia, the Committee remains outside our authority. Maybe it is the permission to run for elections that will calm down the ardent North-West?"
POLITICS_KARMBEZSKIY_DESCRIPTION:0 "Leonid Karmbezskiy is a former investigator who took the side of the revolution, seeing in it an opportunity to return to a peaceful and dignified life for many. \n\nLeonid Karmbezskiy became the head of the Zausalinsk Council of Workers' Deputies quickly. Being a very kind and smart Mobian, Karmbezskiy was able to keep calm in the region and his stay in charge without outbreaks of violence. Many deputies say that Leonidas has a unique charisma and knows how to entice anyone with his manner of narration. \n\nOne day, the chairman of the committee began his speech devoted to the problems of agriculture with a short story. "Beautiful time, childhood. I remember me and my friend Vitalik used to play near the barn, and then we'd take care of the cattle and collect the millet." Dead silence, in a more serious voice. "That's the kind of grain our cities are now lacking...""
POLITICS_PISTOLETOV_DESCRIPTION:0 "Alexandr Pistoletov is the most honored officer of the Rethenian Red Fleet, known as the Red Pirate. He is famous for saving his cruiser during the Overlander blockade, exploring the South Pole and nearest islands, rescuing the Great Rethenian Fleet after Robotnik conquered Rethenia and joining the New Year Socialist revolution. Now, Pistoletov is both a head of Brastropolis Council and admiral of the Great Ocean Fleet based in this port city rented from Svyetlales. He proposes his own “pirate” doctrine of enforcing a submarine fleet and building fast missile ships."
###Jackals
INFINITE_DESC:0 "Infinite the Jackal, formerly known as the "Ultimate Mercenary", is believed to be the only saviour of his own nation, damned and humiliated by the United Federation. This jackal was born in poverty as millions of his compatriots. His homeland was no more than a source of cheap oil and gas for the United Federation ruled by puppet king Kamil II, and becoming a mercenary was one of a few ways to earn a living, and the talented boy called Zero choose that way. Zero outplayed all of his opponents and became a leader of his own squad, later known as the Jackal Squad according to GUN databases. \n\nThe government of the United Federation valued his skills and achievements of his squad and offered Zero the contract he could never reject. Thus, the Jackal Squad became one of the elite GUN task groups, carrying out tasks all around the world from Soumerica to Rethenian Civil War, where Zero grew to hate all kinds of socialist ideas after one of his partners was slaughtered during assassination attempts on one of Red Army leaders. Later, he got an objective to raid Eggman's base. The Jackal Squad succeeded and captured a misterious artifact - the Phantom Ruby. Zero refused to give it to GUN ambassador, feeling enchanted by the Ruby. The price he paid for this was terrible...\n\nSoon after this moment, the Jackal Squad was sent on another mission in Bharatsha, where it was deceived and destroyed by GUN batallion and Team Dark led by Shadow the Hedgehog. Zero was the only jackal to survive luckily. Also, he managed to save the Ruby, enforcing connection between himself and this artifact. When he returned to his home county, he saw growing tension between the king and the people. After Jackal people rised against Kamil II, Zero used the power of Phantom Ruby to lead revolutionaries and overthrow the puppet king, killing him and his family. By washing his hands with royal blood, Zero realized that this is the fisrt act of revenge against the United Federation. This jackal believed to have opportunity to avenge his squad and himself and to avenge his people. By rising to power, giving up his own unsightly face and letting go the old himself, the weak one, he obtained the power. He was reborn. He became Infinite.\n\nPortrait based on art by JamoART"
###Acorns
POLITICS_KING_ZOG_DESC:0 "His Majesty, King Maximillian Acorn, also known as Maximillian the Cursed. Himself, he is not destined to be hated by his people, but the period of his ruling is. Being 58 years old, King Max had his own health collapsed by two wars and one assassination attempt. He led the country through the worst times of its history: the Great War with Overlanders, First Robotnik War when the Kingdom was toppled by Julian Kintobor, known as Ivo Robotnik. After the end of First Robotnik War, his throne was restored, but the vortex of history approaches the old king with dramatically degrading health, threatening his heirs and the whole House of Acorns. It is a matter of time whether Maximillian the Cursed will die on his throne or abdicate in order to give his title to his newly revealed son and legitimate heir, prince Elias Acorn whose childish nature can barely cope with the chaos inevitably approaching the nation."
###Eggman
POLITICS_EGGMAN_DESC:0 "Doctor Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik is rightful and devoted successor of Robotnik Prime's cause. For Mobius Prime, doctor Eggman is like a bolt from a blue appearing from literally nothing. But still, he had a consistent story of his own, different from Robotnik Prime. \n\nIn fact, this Robotnik came from alternative dimension. Doctor Ivo Robotnik was born in Overlanders' world. Both Robotnik Prime and Eggman come from an antient line of human scientists known as Kintobor. Julian Kintobor was born in 3189. He never was a fair person - he framed his teacher Nate Morgan so as to take over his laboratory; later he used his post of weaponry engineer of Overlanders' Empire during the Great War to experiment his weapons on his own compatriots; after being brought to trial, he escaped and offered his services to Acorns, making it possible for them to win the war over Overlanders; finally, he staged a coup d'état against Acorns and conquered Mobius. The difference in timelines occured in the year of 3232, when Eggman roboticized himself to defeat Freedom Fighters, unlike Robotnik Prime who stood in his biological body. This allowed Eggman, known as Robo-Robotnik, to survive the destruction of his body in the final fight against Sonic and Freedom Fighters. He managed to transport his digital consciousness to an incomplete and derelict space station he had created for other purposes. Robo-Robotnik prepared another plan of revenge. A long time after his putative death, he created another robotic body, constructed nuclear warheads and destroyed Mobotropolis of his dimension, wiping out Sonic and the entire royal family from his universe. \n\nRobo-Robotnik had already known a lot about alternative dimensions - it was even happened to meet Robotnik Prime. Both Robotniks were able to travel through different universes, and meeting with Robotnik Prime inspired Robo-Robotnik a lot. But when he destroyed his enemies, he lost the sense of living. But by this moment he had found up that Robotnik Prime was destroyed. Robo-Robotnik decided to "fill the void" of another world and invaded Mobius Prime, taking over remnants of fallen Robotnik Empire in his newly created organic body. In this body he became known as doctor Eggman. Considering his experience of roboticization and destroying Freedom Fighters in his own dimension, doctor Eggman has become more dangerous enemy than his predecessor..."
###Acorns
MONBOL_SALLY:0 "The fate of Queen Sally is hard to call the easy one, but her story is still interesting. She was the first legitimate female heir to the throne: as King Maximilian Acorn considered his only son dead, he raised his daughter as the future Queen of all Mobius. Sally grew up to be a smart and erudite girl who led the Knothole Freedom Fighters and managed to defeat Robotnik in 3235. Sally proved herself capable of ruling the people better than her father, and she was ready to assume the throne until her brother Elias appeared after years of absence. He, as the king's only son, was destined to take the throne instead of a princess who knew about political issues. \n\nIt was a big mistake. Sally realized it too late to save the situation with the methods she knew, but her brother's whole reign was a failure. The young and weak king Elias was the victim of manipulation by reactionary officers and court sorcerer Ixis Nagus, and Elias’s policy put the kingdom on the verge of destruction in the civil war. There was a severe moral blow to Elias – collapse of the Freedom Accord, leaving the kingdom one-on-one with the sinister Eggman Empire. Unable to deal with the country's internal problems and prepare the country for war, Elias abdicated, transmitting the power to his sister. \n\nSally acted in politics as both a pragmatist and a romantic. She would do anything for her people, even if she had to sacrifice the honor of her family, even if she had to doubt the principles of dynasty. Sally does not seek to preserve the monarchy, but she seeks to save her own people, and communist Rethenian government was the only one to offer cooperation. Sally herself was influenced by Rethenian experience, having her views on socialism revised. RCSR's example gave her hope that she would also be able to lead her people to prosperity, but without abandoning the traditions of her family. She decided to bring them to a new level instead. Queen Sally is now leading her people along the path of socialism because she believes that the friendship between her Kingdom and Council Rethenia will bring back the peace and prosperity that the Mobian workers have dreamed of for so long, tired of endless wars."
POLITICS_DICT_AMADEUS_DESC:0 "The "Conductor of the Battlefield", the "Space Exile", the hero, the traitor... Amadeus Prower is a fox with a tough and fascinating story. It was a long way for general Prower, starting as a boy in a family of magical heritage and ending as the most powerful person to challenge Eggman.\n\nThe military science was his own interest of youth. Unlike his brother, he decided to join the military instead of continuing studying the magic. He became famous on the battlefields of the Great War as a brave warrior and brilliant strategist. During the Siege of Mobotropolis Amadeus Prower led the charge against Overlander forces, but lost his left eye by a lucky shot. Soon after Overlander troops seized Mobotropolis, Amadeus Prower led a counter-offensive and reclaimed the capital of the Kingdom, becoming a hero of the Royal Army. He had also mastered his military skill by leading the Special Forces Team. \n\nShortly after the Great War ended, Amadeus was promoted to General and Second-in-Command of the Royal Army, he married Rosemary Prower and was expecting a baby. But Robotnik's coup d'état had ruined all of his plans. Though Rosemary gave birth to her son Miles, who would be further famous as Tails, both spouses had been roboticized, but saved by alien residents called Bem. The Bem deroboticized Amadeus and Rosemary, giving them a chance to live in comfort on their homeworld of Argentum for 11 years.\n\nAmadeus Prower had returned on Mobius as soon as he had such possibility, but he had been inspired by Bem democratic and equal society. He had decided to embody their progressive social structure on Mobius, seeing all the weaknesses of Acorn's monarchy. He led the federalist Republican movement dedicated to establishing democracy on the territory of the Kingdom of Acorn. General Prower became an interim president of the Northamer Federal Republic after the revoltuion started, he led the Revolutionary Republican Army to victory over the Royalists, Confederates and Socialists. After the dust of the civil war settled, Amadeus Prower expected to resign and spend the rest of his life with his family, but the tragedy happened again. His wife, a presidental candidate by that time, had been killed by unknown assassins during the terrorist attack organized by radicals. This event shocked him a lot, forcing him to take power back. The country is still not safe..."
POLITICS_WRENCH_DESC:0 "William James Marble, also known as Bill Wrench, has long been the most influential radical leftist in Acorn lands, is a unique example of a union leader. William was able to make his way to Haywood Aviation College and qualify as a high-ranking worker at the Kingdom's largest aircraft factory. The harsh realities of proletarian life overtook him not less than his father. A man of combative character, an ambitious disposition and a bright mind, Bill organized the first union of the aviation industry workers that was able to grow from a single work floor to cover the entire Titanium Belt. Bill Wrench actively defended the interests of workers in his industry. He was especially shocked by ab incident caused by the obvious cuts on safety equipment: the wing of the plane that fell from the attachment wounded Wrench and took the lives of several of his comrades. Barely recovering from his injury, he continued to work and fight, even surviving the arrest - the outbreak of the Great War and conversion of industry goals hit the union forces hard, equating their leaders to criminals and spies. \n\nPrison further influenced Wrench's life, as he met several important workers in the labour movement, including the journalist Jack Red. Both were paroled after 2 years in prison for exemplary behaviour, and Jack suggested that he and Wrench join forces of the Katzerist and trade union organizations into a united workers' front. Workers in large cities willingly joined the Union of Workers of Mobius movement, hoping to continue the fight after the war. As soon as one war ended, another one began - Robotnik overthrew the Acorns and took control of the country with a swift blow, but the workers of Wrench's plant, together with their leader and his comrades, were able to escape by moving several planes by train and flying to Retenia from the nearest airfield. \n\nSettled in Rethenia, Wrench helped the revolutionary movement in both Robotnik and Civil wars. He befriended Pallasov and other RPRA leaders, learning from their experience and helping them organizing the new Rethenian aviation industry. Wrench and Red returned to their homeland 10 years after they fled the city determined to see the unfinished business through to the end. Having re-established contact with UWM, Comrade Wrench is preparing his "One Big Union" for another revolution."

However, he never considers himself an eternal leader of a new nation, promising to establish democratic institutions and retire after the war ends."
ELIAS_DESC:0 "Prince Elias Acorn is a son of Maximillian the Cursed. Though he was the legitimate heir, he disappeared during his evacuation. Raised by Echidnas in Angel Island and later by the Sommersby family living in the royal compound of this floating island, Elias became an adventurous person not caring about the consequences of his actions. His happy and careless youth was ended after he had been discovered by Royal Secret Services and returned home. He was expected to assume the throne after his father’s possible death, but the inexperienced and naive prince caused a lot of damage to Freedom Fighters during several operations and went into voluntary exile. Traitorous Geoffrey St. John was at fault, but Elias blamed himself. He was persuaded by Sonic to return and reclaim his birthright one year later. Elias Acorn annulled Sally’s marriage with evil Patch d’Coolette who was trying to assume the throne by marrying Sally. Elias denounced the usurper and secured his place as legitimate heir of king Max, but the true challenge has only begun for this young and unexperienced heir.\n\nIt was Sally Acorn who was brought up as a future heir of the throne. Elias is neither skilled nor popular to rule the country, and this is the major problem for his rule. He knows the boundaries of his possibilities well, but has no clue what to do outside of them, so he is vulnerable to manipulations from various political forces active at the Royal court, usually not caring about the people and maintaining only their own interests. If Elias is not confident, he listens to his father whose vision on politics is obviously obsolete and harmful in current realities. These factors made Elias rule fragile, and many believe that the Spy King will be the last Acorn of the senior branch."
POLITICS_Doddward_DESC:0 "Diamond Godward is a proud and agile aristocrat who is willing to do anything to achieve his goal and to glorify his ancient aristocratic lineage. He is proud that his ancestors were the leaders of many rebellions of the Southern Baronies against the order of the Acorns, and he hopes to be not only worthy of their memory, but also the one who will bring their cause to an end and fulfill the dream of freedom of their homeland. \n\nAs a typical Southern aristocrat, Diamond felt that, soon after birth, his destiny was to rule, to be a master. Having received excellent secondary education at home, Diamond joined the society of the Abraham High School. The society of young and noble Mobians became for him, in fact, the real test. It was necessary to earn the right to be the carrier of knightly honor with courage and cunning. To be confirmed in the high society, young Godward got there where nobody else expected to achieve glory - in the chess club. Many laughed at Diamond, believing that the self-taught could not achieve any notable success. But Godward made fast progress in the chess club and even broke into the Baron Chess Tournament. In the final, he faced the most worthy opponent - the champion of many years, the old General Abigail Bragg. The young man who defeated the general received his handshake, and the conversation with the general inspired Godward to think about political issues. The general gave him a place in the secret Southern Union. \n\nDuring his years in the secret alliance, Godward realized that the notion of knightly honor had a reverse side. Intrigues surrounded him, and to survive, among other things, to support the inherited farm, Diamond had to adapt. Having destroyed his rivals and enemies, Godward became the head of the Southern Union, which almost in full went to the front of the Great War, but after the Robotnik coup d'etat was forced to adapt to the new regime or die. Godward chose the former, but even then he continued to fight underground, supplying the local resistance. The very fact that the Acorns allowed the horrors of two wars to the Baronies' lands set Diamond against the Acorns, and after the country's liberation, Godward decided to continue the struggle for the Barons' interests more openly. The Southern Union was reformed into the Confederation of the Southern Baronies."

POLITICS_REGINA_DESC:0 "Regina Ferrum belonged to the ancient cult of technomages who lived in lands of the Overlanders for many years. Unfortunately, when the Great War began, the government imposed a ban on technomages' activities, and the entire cult of Magitek was dissolved and arrested. Regina was the only cultist that won the mercy of the authorities - referring to her young age, she was released from detention but expelled from the country. The girl set out to wander the world, trying to find other techno-magicians. The injustice and war she saw during the years of wandering impressed her, as did the omnipresent prejudices of others. Realizing that she was the last living adept of Magitek developed into her messianic, but at the same time conceited, moods. She believed that it was she who was destined to change the society, connecting the world of spirit and the world of technology. \n\nThe roads took her to Sishang, known as the Dragon Kingdom or Wulongyuan. In the north of the country, she saw the devastation caused by the endless Dujun wars. But here she saw the opportunity - Jun Kun, one of the most powerful militarists. It was a union of mutual benefit: Jun enjoyed the benefits of Magitek, and Regina quickly rose to power, legitimizing her rule through Jun. But even despite the first successes, their clique has never been able to strike a decisive defeat as they consolidated all other warlords against Jun. Defeats from the united forces of the region were permanent. \n\nEverything changed when Jun and Regina encountered Robotnik. They promised him that the duumvirate would become Robotnik’s foothold in Sishang. After entering ceremonial marriage, they proclaimed themselves Iron King and Iron Queen, the Iron Dominion was proclaimed. Reinforced by Robotnik's arms, the Iron Dominion was able to take over almost the entire country, but the combined forces of the free cities that formed Aiguojun led the Iron Dominion into the War of Resistance for 10 years, gaining the support of Knothole Freedom Fightees, until when in 3235 they pushed the Dominion forces to the far north. \n\nThe Iron Dominion drew lessons from its last defeat, but the contradiction between the Iron Queen and the Iron King began to grow. They accused each other of defeat. The Iron Queen had her own picture of the world, and the traditions to which Jun was devoted were not part of them. Having defeated her husband, Regina now leads the Iron Dominion herself with an iron hand. With an iron hand, she intends to unite the spiritual and technological foundations of civilization."

POLITICS_SHADOW:0 "Leader. Radical. Immortal. These are words some would use to describe Shadow the Hedgehog, while none of these are wrong, it would also be incorrect to say they are right. \n\nShadow was not born, instead he was grown on the Space Colony ARK as part of a Classified Military Project. Created by none other than the Grandfather of Doctor Eggman, Gerald Kintobor. He was made with dual purposes, the first was as a weapon of war and destruction to be used against GUN’s enemies.

Upon being awakened, Shadow struck up a sibling-like bond with Maria and they were practically inseparable, even if he was unable to provide the Cure.\n\nSuch a life was short lived however. \n\nGUN raided the facility upon finding out Gerald was lying to them about the progress of the project as well as its purpose. Arresting or executing the research staff for treason. Shadow and Maria desperately tried to escape, but the young girl sacrificed her own life to save Shadow’s, ejecting him out of an escape pod. After a brief period of hiding, Shadow would eventually be captured and placed in stasis for 50 years. \n\nUpon being awoken, he aimed to fulfill Maria’s dying wish, which he misinterpreted as a desire for revenge. It was only through the selfless actions of Amy Rose that he was able to remember it was instead a desire for peace and harmony. With a new vigor for life, he sacrificed himself to prevent the ARK from crashing into Mobius. He went missing for six months, until he resurfaced while working alongside known thief Rouge the Bat and a Badnik defector known as E-123 Omega. Suffering from Amnesia, Shadow worked desperately to regain his memories, a quest he was unable to fulfill for years. \nHe would join GUN, becoming the leader of ‘Team Dark’, which consisted of himself, Rouge and Omega. He laid waste to armies, assassinated traitors and led great battles in the name of peace. Eventually he had enough. With his image of a hero amongst the people, the backing of parts of the military and one of the most experienced tactical minds in the world, Shadow was able to stage a local coup and take the first step in conquering the rest of the UF in order to establish a new regime in its place. \n\nWhat Shadow plans to do with this power is by far what most people are afraid of. To some, he is a hero and liberator, dedicated to creating a world free of war and hunger. To others he is a brutal militarist who wants nothing more than global conquest."
