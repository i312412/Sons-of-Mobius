The Second Robotnik War was the clearest testimony of all the weaknesses of the Acorn absolute monarchy. Tired of the arbitrary rule of the king, many sectors of society saw in Elias' ascension to the throne not hope, but as the continuation of the nightmare. General Amadeus Prower rallied democratically minded officers and intellectuals around him. The Southern Baronies, devastated by war and unaided by the King, remember their rebellious past. The socialist unions in the Titanium Belt are organising a militia and preparing a general strike. If the right measures are not taken, the Kingdom of Acorn will very soon meet its end on the scaffold...\n\nLoyalty to £crown!§CElias Acorn§!: §C[?KOA.loyalty_elias]§!\n£rifles!§ORepublican§! political power: §O[?KOA.prower_power]§!\n£rabbit!§YConfederate§! political power: §Y[?KOA.baron_power]§!\n£red_star!§RSocialist§! political power: §R[?KOA.union_power]§!"
