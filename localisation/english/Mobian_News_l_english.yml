mobiannews.1.d:0 "I've come to make an announcement, Shadow the Hedgehog's a bitch-ass motherfucker. He pissed on my fucking wife. That's right. He took his hedgehog fuckin' quilly dick out and he pissed on my FUCKING wife, and he said his dick was t h i s b i g and I said that's disgusting. So I'm making a callout post on my Twitter dot com: Shadow the Hedgehog, you got a small dick. It's the size of this walnut except WAY smaller. And guess what? Here's what my dong looks like. (explosion sounds) That's right, baby. Tall points, no quills, no pillows, Look at that, it looks like two balls and a bong. He fucked my wife, so guess what, I'm gonna fuck the earth. That's right, this is what you get! My SUPER LAZER PISS! Except I'm not gonna piss on the earth. I'm gonna go higher. I'm pissing on the MOOOON! (piss boom) How do you like that, OBAMA? I PISSED ON THE MOON, YOU IDIOT! You have twenty-three hours before the piss d r o p l e t s hit the fucking earth, now get out of my fucking sight before I piss on you too!"

mobiannews.2.d:0 "Robotnik's invading army was almost completely destroyed by the return of Sonic and the combined efforts of several outstanding Acorn commanders. For the first time the so-called "Eggman" was dealt a crushing military defeat by the regular Acorn army. Nevertheless, both sides of the conflict were left extremely exhausted: Robotnik's army, which had lost its fighting ability, needed renewal, and His Majesty's war-weary subjects were not ready for a victorious march deep into the Eggman Empire. A tacit cease-fire was negotiated - the parties agreed not to take aggressive action for the next 3 years."
