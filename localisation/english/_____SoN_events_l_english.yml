    koa.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Acorn remained the beacon of hope of the entire Mobian world for many centuries, and the Crown of the Acorns enjoyed authority throughout all Mobius. In 2320, Alexander Acorn, inspired by the contacts with the echidna civilization, entered into an alliance with several tribal leaders, who soon afterwards elected him as their king. 'Tis when Alexander Acorn was henceforth known as “King Alexander the Unifier”, which marked the beginning of the Acorn Dynasty. Then, Alexander set out to unite all the peoples of the Mobian Oekumene into one state to enjoy the common prosperity. Even though he failed to persuade the proud and warlike echidnas and the Overlanders to join the Kingdom of Acorn, the rest of the Mobian principalities willingly allied with the new dynasty, receiving protection and provisions in return. \n\nThe echidnas remained neutral to Alexander’s Big Game, but the Overlanders took an aggressive stance. After an Overlander accidentally shot Prince Emerson Acorn, the son of Alexander, King Theodore the Bereaved broke all diplomatic relations with the Overlanders, closed the borders and banned all firearms. Since then, the Acorns and Overlanders had a history of run-ins, but this did not stop the Acorns from building a powerful empire over which the sun never set.\n\nThe Acorns were famous for their political wisdom and kindness, but like any other dynasty, even they experienced difficulties. The development of industrial production and the formation of capitalism in the vassal countries undermined the foundations of the entire system of the Empire. National liberation bourgeois revolutions took place all over the empire, for which the conservative Acorns were practically unprepared. One of the few who met the challenges of the time was King Frederick the Gracious, who invited the scientists of the Overlanders and the Order of Naugus to the country. \n\nThe Overlanders pursue industrialization and boosted technological progress, prompting Naugus, the Royal Wizard of the Acorns, to provoke a war to get rid of the Overlanders, whose technology depreciated his magic. As soon as Maximilian Acorn ascended to the throne in 3215, the Great War, provoked by Naugus and his accomplices, began, in it the Overlanders clashed in a fierce battle with the Mobians."

    koa.2.d:0 "Утром 10 января, когда ничто не предвещало беды, в центре Моботрополиса прогремел мощный взрыв. Грохот разорвавшейся взрывчатки и поднявшееся в небо облако дыма в условиях продолжающейся войны с Эггманом вселило панику в горожан, ранее ожидавших, что война уже не вернется в столицу Королевства. В прочем, как оказалось впоследствии, страхи горожан не оправдались. Взрыв раздался со стороны предместий центра заключения, совсем недалеко от стен исправительного учреждения. На удивление, не пострадал никто кроме одной крайне весомой цели - колдун Иксис Нагус. Совершенно неожиданный для него взрыв не оставил ему ни единого шанса на выживание. Хоть само его тело не поддавалось распознанию, ряд разбросанных вокруг места взрыва атрибутов позволял точно определить, что погиб именно колдун. Многие желали смерти Иксису Нагусу с тех пор, как общественность узнала о его преступлениях в попытках захватить престол. Боевые организации СРМ и Золотого Легиона одновременно взяли на себя ответственность за это убийство, пытаясь на этой почве завоевать политические очки, но СМИ опровергли их причастность. Это событие положило конец всем дворцовым интригам, учинённым колдуном, и его смерть вселила спокойствие в сознание подданых Акорнов."

    koa.4.d:0 "Увы, мир меняется, и печальна участь тех монархов, которые не осознают этого. Ещё во время Великой войны и Первой войны Роботника никто и не думал о революции. Король Максимилиан Акорн был поддержан всеми слоями населения в этой борьбе, но Вторая война Роботника, настолько бездарно начатая и нерешительно продолжавшаяся вплоть до уничтожения Нотхолла - исторического сердца национально-освободительной борьбы подданных Акорнов, - вывалила на стол весь пучок противоречий и проблем, развившихся в обществе Королевства.\nЭта война поставила под сомнение способность абсолютной монархии адекватно справляться с ситуацией. Вместе с позорными поражениями Королевской Армии Акорнам припомнили теперь упадок отечественной промышленности, неспособной конкурировать с продукцией Соединенной Федерации, и повальную коррупцию, и неспособность урегулировать ситуацию с отказывающимися платить налоги южными баронами, и полное игнорирование проблем подданных. Против благородных фамилий в суде всякий подданный был бессилен. После Первой войны Роботника наступил новый сельскохозяйственный кризис, который хоть и не привел к такому повальному голоду, как в Ретении годами раннее, но снова вогнал страну в долги и поставил под сомнение осмысленность дальнейших войн за честь короны Акорнов. «Технологический консерватизм» - еще одна причина недовольства промышленной буржуазии подданства Эйкорнов. Вместо свободного расширения капитала они вынуждены считаться с тормозящими промышленность «мобианские» ценности по сбережению природы, в результате чего Оверлэндеры давно превзошли мобианцев технологически и экономически. Демократ требует создания республики, чтобы снять регрессивные квоты на промышленное строительство, в один голос с генералом Амадеем Прауэром, вернувшегося с планеты Аргентум из изгнания вместе со своей женой.\nНесмотря на проделанные на Юге реформы, сепаратистские настроения не только не ослабли, но и усилились, перерастая в радикальные и экстремистские требования об изменения порядка на всех землях, которые сейчас находятся в подданстве Акорнов. Взирая позорное отступление Королевской Армии второй половины прошлого года, брошенные на погибель под стальным катком Эггмана южане сильно разочаровались в королевской власти. Разнородные политические силы Юга объединились в один альянс, от плутократической Конфедерации Южных Баронов, возглавляемой бароном Додвардом, до национал-популистской организации "Золотой Легион" Мэттью Натшелла.\nРабочий вопрос в Королевстве Акорнов не решался никоим образом. Если с начала Великой войны до конца Первой войны Роботника до этого никому не было дела, то теперь, когда миллионы рабочих Титановго пояса возвращаются домой и сталкиваются с полным бесправием, безработицей и нищетой, рабочий класс начинает задумываться о необходимости повторения ретенского опыта. Джек СиндиКэт, амбициозный адвокат и профсоюзный лидер, уже преуспел в объединении всех социалистических организаций в Союз Рабочих Мобиуса, и теперь ищет путей для соглашения с генералом Прауэром."

Бешенную популярность стал набирать губернатор Сильванианы Льюис Хонг, известный как первый в истории Южных Баронств чиновник без благородного происхождения. Будучи выходцем из простого народа и одним из самых храбрых стрелков Борцов за Свободу Юга, Хонг снискал славу как среди обездоленных крестьян, так и среди зарождающейся южной промышленной буржуазии. В результате последней реформы территориального управления 3235 года Хонг смог прорваться на пост через демократические выборы. И теперь, имея голос от созданной им Партии Южных Королей, выступает со своей речью в Эпин-Руж перед десятками тысяч свих сторонников:\n\n"Подданные короля Акорна, жители Нортамера, землепашцы, честные трудяги, честные предприниматели. Тысячу лет монархия Акорнов оставалось символом доброты, щедрости, единства и сострадания. Но когда я открываю глаза сегодня, в 3236 году, я вижу перед собой жизнь не по принципам, заложенным Александром Объединителем! Нет! Я вижу, как распадается наше общество. Оно распадается, потому что кучка аристократов жирует, пока трудолюбивые крестьяне обнашивают лохмотья десятки лет. Оно распадается, потому что наша родина уже давно продана корпорациям Оверлэндеров. Оно распадается, потому что один процент населения владеет всем, а все остальные - ничем! Никто владеет всем - и все остальные владеют ничем. Эра Акорнов подходит к концу, потому что ушла в небытие эпоха их честности и добродетели. Красно-чёрные бандиты, проплаченные Палласовым, орудуют на севере, и в этом виноваты бароны. Вместе с ними цепные псы генерала Прауэра ведут террор от имени корпораций. Акорны игнорируют тот факт, что аристократы и олигархи сдирают с наш шкуру. Граждане Нортамера! Я верю, что в один момент мы станем гражданами, членами одной семьи, придерживающейся вековых традиций справедливости. Я готов заявить смело: мы будем королями своей жизни, и мы ни дадим себе притеснять никого, ни дадим никому притеснять честных мобианцев!"\n\nРечь была отмечена бурными овациями и апплодисментами. Хонг давал автографы своей роботизированной рукой всем желающим. Речь вызвала бурную реакцию в СМИ и поизвела колассальный эффект на многие города и деревни Южных Баронств. Даже за пределами Юга Королевства у Хонга появляются сторонники. Растущая популярность южного популиста стала ярким свидетельством радикализации всех слоев общества Нортамера..."

The famous General Prower gained more and more credibility among the masses; even the socialists who do not support the "bourgeois-democratic officer" ideologically see him as the leader of the workers' vanguard until Acorn absolutism is destroyed. The time for him to lead the people has come.\nThis morning, at 11:15 AM, on Alexander the Unifier Street, they marched towards the gates of Castle Acorn. The march was peaceful, despite radical slogans and reckless behavior from some of the activists. It would be remembered how Prower personally took the red flag away from one of his column participants, not allowing them to hoist revolutionary banners. The leader of the protest commanded the spearhead of his column to raise their hands with white pieces of cloth instead. They demonstrated no intentions of violence, and had been marching towards the castle for thirty minutes before the Royal Guard battalion blocked their path.\nThe general himself met the Royal Guard, fearlessly staring down the warriors pulling their carbines from their shoulders and preparing to aim their weapons at the mob.\n"King Elias must come to negotiations and hear all the demands of the Nine Peoples' Delegates!" he declared boldly.\nIt became obvious that they were going to demand democratic reforms and the immediate establishment of elected bodies. Among those demands would most certainly be urgent measures to improve the conditions of workers in factories and farmers in the fields.\nThis outrageous move of the opposition can't be left without our King's response!"

It was unclear who gave the order in the heat of the moment, or if any order was given for the military to approach the column from different sides. The Royal Army had been involved in riot suppression before. This was to have been a routine operation.\nAt first, the Royal Guard troops took warning shots around the mob to force their dispersion. One of the junior soldiers mistakenly raised their carbines and, armed with live ammunition, aimed directly at them. One of the demonstrators -- a farmer pig -- was shot dead where he stood, and his blood painted General Prower's royal blue uniform.\nThe government lost control of the situation. Chaos overtook the scene as several protestors ran away in fear and a significant remnant stayed behind to attack the army without any leader to command them. Royal soldiers shot to kill in a frenzied panic to protect themselves from the incensed mob, and the resulting massacre claimed the lives of around three hundred Acorn subjects.\nPrower barely managed to escape the pandemonium, and now his whereabouts are unknown. No singular individual claimed responsibility for the crimes committed that dark day, but the public have judged King Elias guilty for responding to their call for peace with murder. Revolutionary organizations have taken the opportunity to spread extremely radical proclamations in the wake of his silence."

Finally, Amadeus Prower called for democratic revolution and progressive reforms not just to rebuild the country and create an efficient army, but to ensure the prosperity of the people. \n\nThis morning, general Amadeus Prower has repeated the theses of the leaflet during his public speech held in New Mobotropolis Civic Center. He has focused on the political side of his views. Supported by the mob, he has inflamed the atmosphere of the meeting. He has raised the White Stars Maroon Banner and brought the new slogan forward: "Stand By the People, Bring Down the Crown!". \n\nThe end of his speech has been met by rioting applause and chanting. This speech has inspired thousands of people to openly support general Prower's cause, and it was just a question of time if he will be able to orgranize an army to revolt."

The text briefly described the political situation in the Kingdom and the disposition of forces, explained the need to consolidate democratic forces against an incompetent monarchical regime and the call for negotiations addressed to Billy Wrench, leader of the Union of Workers of Mobius and General Amadeus Prower, the leader of the Federalist Party of the Kingdom of Acorn. \n\nSoon after a short silence Jack Red, the Deputy Chairman of UWM, left for the Prower HQ to negotiate with Amadeus and Rosemary. After a night of intense negotiations, the "United Republican Front Act" was drawn up. It described general aspirations for democracy, ultimate disillusionment with the institution of monarchy, and the prevention of the accession of anti-popular forces such as the Golden Legion. The Front favors the unity of all forces fighting against the tyrants of Acorns, Eggman and Southern reactionaries, the establishment of a single democratic government and the holding of fair elections. \n\nMany believe that the Front is the only thing guaranteeing the unity of the progressive forces of Northamer, although some analysts are skeptical of this adventure, predicting its rapid collapse. Nevertheless, the monarch now has to reckon with a huge, united and powerful opposition."

He was immortalized in old photographs and hazy memories as a symbol for strength and unity in times of strife. The Overlanders who fled to the United Federation would recognize King Max as the warrior-king who defeated Overlord Charlemagne in single combat and won the Great War for the good of his people.\n\nThe years have not been kind to Max. In the time since that short-lived victory against the Overland, the monarch had suffered tragedy after tragedy. Grave betrayal at the hands of his Warlord Robotnik, mystical enslavement in the service of his court wizard Naugus, the lost of his ability to walk in a grievous injury, and only barely surviving an attempt on his life at the hands of a royal guard's impersonator.\n\nA difficult life with strains beyond that which all but the most tenacious could bear have robbed King Maximilian the Cursed of his youth and wizened him beyond his years. His mind was not spared from the ravages of these hardships, but he knew in his heart that his time on the throne was nearing its end.\nHis son Elias would be the next king. He was inexperienced, but Max knew that Elias had the strong will needed to lead their people through the coming dark times. King Max had no doubts that his daughter Sally would be a model queen if anything were to happen to Elias, but tradition dictated she must wed before assuming power. Now that Prince Elias was an eligible heir, Max no longer sought to pressure Sally into what should always have been her own decision.\n\nOr perhaps he discovered a spark of sentimentality in his otherwise bitter bouts of senility. Max had only the best intentions for his children and his nation, but intent meant little in the grand scheme of history. Only cause and effect bore fruit."

The damage the madman wrought across the world was severe, and now there would be time to heal where the thought of recovery once looked impossible. It seemed as though, for the first time in years, the Kingdom of Acorn truly had a second chance to pick itself up off the ground and grow anew.\n\nNICOLE did the heavy lifting, but that did not mean the work was done. The Kingdom of Acorn had always been wary of reckless expansion and industrialization, witnessing firsthand the ruinous path it led the Overland towards. Increasing the industrial capacity of the nation without compromising the health and safety of its citizens would be a slow and deliberate process. There was no shortage of people looking for work once the gears of the economy began to churn like they used to.\n\nA difficulty encountered in the Kingdom's reindustrialization program was the rise of organized labor movements. Large groups of workers, many congregated in the former Overland territories of the North, have formed cliques and been less than cooperative in regard to the crown's production quotas. The King has been patiently ignoring their less violent demonstrations and protests, but his patience is starting to wear thin. Many things are up to negotiation, but the needs of the nation are not."

Sticking to the traditional bias against industrialization and the firearms ban set forth by past monarchs have left the Kingdom of Acorn woefully outclassed in a modern war for survival.\n\nTo General Prower's shock upon resuming command of his former post, the most reliable weapons the Royal Army had were bows and arrows! Relics and toys of little use during the Great War and worthless against Eggman's horde, to say nothing of how quaint they were in comparison to the planet-scouring superweapons brought to bear over Argentum. Amadeus knew that his task of forming a national guard would be challenging when he accepted the charge from his King, but he underestimated how little had improved while he was gone.\n\n"The more things change," mused Amadeus, "The more we must adapt to overcome."\n\nThis discontentment would not, however, prevent the famous "Conductor of the Battlefield" who resisted the Overland occupation of Mobotropolis from performing his solemn duty. If anything, his desire for change was what drove him forward.

The ceremonial pool that hosted the Source of All was immediately vaporized, leaving King Max's crown and sword as the only remnants of what was once the Acorn family's wondrous heritage. These two relics would be exploited by enemies of the kingdom, until the Crown and Sword of Acorn were destroyed before their righteous qualities could be defiled further.\n\nWith that, the Acorns' link to Source of All was utterly extinguished. Elias and Sally were to be the first Acorns in generations not to be graced by a bonding experience with the Source, leaving Maximilian with no small amount of uncertainty over the future. Would his children have all of the knowledge they needed to weather the oncoming storms?\n\nMaximilian did not know, and he had no Source from which to draw the truth; his wellspring of answers had run dry."

Though intended to be a temporary affair until we could retake Mobotropolis, the city, known in its final days as “Robotropolis”, was nuked by the United Federation. We still manage to siphon the contained fallout and refine it into rings.\n\nKnothole would remain the capital of our Kingdom until an assault by the Eggman Empire. Around the same time, one of Eggman’s rogue minions, ADAM, constructed a city composed entirely of nanites. His plan was foiled, but not without cost. Most notably, the life of Freedom Fighter Tommy Turtle. The advanced AI NICOLE, however, was able to take control of the city and convert it into a near-exact replica of Mobotropolis before the war.\n\nThe King was amazed by her accomplishments, but the city lacked much of the factories that were operational during the Great War. He wandered the halls of his castle, looking for the AI, until he remembered she could appear anywhere she was needed.\n“NICOLE, I require your assistance.”\nA hologram of a female lynx in a purple toga appeared before him.\n“What is your request, your majesty?”\n\nHer voice, though flat and neutral, sounded more lifelike every day. Max was not quite sure where the Freedom Fighters' artificial assistant came from, though it was not terribly important to him at this time.\n“NICOLE,” he said, “I will need you to expand the city. We need to get our industry back in order.”\n“Expand the city?” she asked with a look of concern. “With all due respect, my ability to protect the city is dependent on how many nanites are bound to structures and how far I can exert my control. We just finished construction, and doing an expansion could be--”\n“It would only be a minor expansion,” King Max interrupted. “Additional space for a few factories to be built at a later date. Is that within your capabilities?”\n\nNICOLE became static as she ran the numbers on her mainframe.\n“We can spare the material. One moment, please.”\nHer avatar dissolved in an instant.

In order to win back the faith and goodwill of the people, George’s son Abraham handed out fiefdoms in the fertile South and promoted numerous landowning farmers to nobility overnight. The title of baron and the independence that came with it greatly increased the wealth and prosperity of the region, to the extent that the more influential barons conveniently forgot which crown they owed their title to.\n\nKeeping the more unruly barons in line would be a frequent headache for future regents, though no one could predict the extent of treachery they would sink to during the Great War. As a part of a gamble for outright secession, several barons conspired with the Overland to tear the Kingdom apart from within. These acts of treason were foiled, but the idea that the Acorns were “oppressing” the Baronies with their edicts was an old sentiment that would linger. Even when all that remained of the territories were scattered estates and ill-formed dreams of confederacy.\n\nNow that the Kingdom of Acorn is entering a new status quo, the remaining barons and their holdings will need to be carefully watched in order to prevent them from rebelling again."

Only half of the people who once lived there had returned, the rest having been lost as robians in the years that passed since. Immigrants from Northamer and Yurashia have made up for that number, fresh faces seeking new opportunities wherever they could be found.\nA red marsupial hopped in a vest hopped down the street and greeted the king with a bow.\n\n“G’day, yer majesty!” said Walt the Wallaby, leader of the Downunda Freedom Fighters. Behind him were the other members of his crew: Barby Koala, Wombat Stu, Guru Emu, and Bill Platypus. Each of them were brave, loyal soldiers; Max vaguely recalled the wombat fellow was a member of his secret service. “Enjoyin’ yer time in our neck of the woods?”\nKing Max nodded.\n“I trust the repairs to the city are going as per schedule?”\n“Ahead of schedule, sir! Why, I reckon the city will be right as rain by the end of the month!”\n“Excellent. I will leave the rest of the oversight to you, Walter.

Those lost years saw the fall of ancient nations and the rise of new ones to replace them, the largest of which lied under the surface of Mobius for ages untold.\n\nThe old kingdoms of North Efrika collapsed into brutal civil war and were torn apart by internal strife. Aside from the Kingdom of Leonus, all that remained of them were footnotes in the history of the United Federation. The U.F. were a sprawling ring of city-states that stretched across multiple continents, the inhabitants consisting primarily of the Overlanders' genetic relatives: Humans. While they were content with staying hidden beneath their fortified mountain bunkers for much of recent history, the looming threat of Doctor Eggman made continued isolation all but impossible.\nIn spite of Max's trepidations about the country when it was first unveiled years ago, President Herbert Wilson proved to be a refreshingly reasonable individual. He has been a dedicated ally against the Eggman Empire, knowing full well that it will take the cooperation of multiple nations to keep that despotic madman in check. King Maximilian Acorn was assured by Wilson that, in spite of the upcoming elections and the possibility of a new leader entering office, there should be no change in their alliance.\n\nWas that a fact, or merely wishful thinking?

Give into the Prowers' demands and turn over the kingdom to an angry mob?"\n"Their visions for the country were inconsolable with ours," she answered tactfully. "Now that Amadeus inspired others to openly rebel against you, we have to be ready to fight. You have our support, Elias."\n"I... Thank you. I'll be with you all shortly."\nElias shut the curtain. He knows the cost will be great, but it is one he will bear on his shoulders.\nFor the kingdom."

    koa.122.d:0 ""I dunno if I can do this, Sal."\nSonic peeked past the curtain, where a flashy set and camera were waiting for him. He looked back to Sally Acorn, who held a clipboard in one hand.\n"Camera shy?" the princess scoffed. "And here I thought you were an attention hog."\nSonic tapped his foot as the counter on the television screen scrolled at a snail's pace.\n"Shouldn't I be out, you know, fighting the good fight? I can say a few lines or sign an autograph at the speed of sound, but I don't have all day for them to make a movie!"\n"People look up to you, Sonic. You're helping the war effort by motivating them to fight the good fight, like you always have."\n"By talking?" he asked warily. "I thought you wanted me to cut the sass since I got kicked up to top brass."\n"Would you do it for a chili dog?"\nSonic was a fast thinker, if quicker to act than think. In the time it took for the "4" on the screen to disperse into tiny pixels and come back together as a "3", he thought long and hard about what he was about to do.\nPeople were going to go to war on his say so. Not against a monster like Eggman, but against people just like them. The hero of Mobius didn't like this any more than any of his friends did. If he knew of any other way to fix this, he'd do it in the blink of an eye.\nIf Sally thought this was the best way, then…\n"Make it five?"\n"Deal."\nThree seconds to go. Sonic stretched his legs and got into position. Right before the timer hit zero, he curled into a ball and hopped out onto the center stage.\n"Hey there, dudes and dudettes!" he declared to the crowd of cameras and adoring fans he's made as the bright blue face of the freedom fighter cause. "I'm Sonic! Sonic the Hedgehog! And I've got a message for everyone on the airwaves!"\nThe next few minutes were a fast-paced call to action for every good citizen to do their part. Enlisting today, buying war bonds, ratting out your neighbors. Whatever it took to win the war. People ate it right up.\nSonic was doing his part, too, but he didn't enjoy every word he had to say.\nHe didn't enjoy the chili dogs he ate after that, either."

The roles of generals, chief engineers, spymasters, or even queens to-be. There was so much uncertainty hanging around how the young heroes of the nation would grow into their new roles.\nTo the surprise and concern of many, Amy Rose quickly acclimated to the task of organizing an armed militia. As one of the most passionate freedom fighters, inspiring a passionate fervor in the civilian population to protect their loved ones was second nature.\n"Swing it like this!" Amy said as she practiced drills with a New Mobotropolis Home Guard. "Like you mean it! And put your backs into it, too!"\nHer volunteers, young and old, kept pace the best they could. In addition to teaching them how to swing for the fences when aiming for the vital areas of invading troops, Agent Rose taught them the basics of what they might see in a standard boot camp.\n"Your friends and family are relying on you to be ready for when the bad guys come knocking! We're doing this for them, got it?"\nThough she presented the material in her unique, energetic way, the training stuck. Thanks to Amy's efforts, the population will be better prepared for the coming days of combat.\nMilitary intelligence has noticed a larger percentage of the population wearing pink after her training regimen, but this has been dismissed as nothing to be concerned of.\n"

Nobody demanded that Rotor make a miracle happen, of course, but that expectation to do the impossible was coming from his biggest critic: Himself.\nEver since the Freedom Fighters first started resisting Robotnik, Rotor was the guy that could get the dangerous gears and machinery around them to work for good instead of evil. He was the guy who could fix anything. One of the first people to take a crack at the de-roboticizer. The first to show Tails how to put together machines of his own.\nBefore Tails left with his dad, of course. He knew Tails was safe from where the fighting was happening, but the Republican army was using technology he was all too familiar with. Technology he helped design to bridge the gap between them and Eggman, now being used against the people of the kingdom.\nRotor sighed and collected his tools from the floor. If Tails was using his brains to help the rebels win, then Rotor was obligated to do the same to protect the rest of his friends. He could force himself to work on at least one new design. Maybe it wasn’t the miracle they needed, but he could hope it would make a difference.\n"

Elias himself would have taken the sword, if he just stood holding them it might as well have been a golf club. No, it needed to go to a worthy warrior, one who lead armes from the front. Two candidates came to mind.\nThe first of these was Antoine D’Coolette. A capable military commander, his family were close allies of the Acorn royals. A devote loyalist and believer in the instiutions that Acorn was founded on, he is an obvious choice. With borad support from the ruiling nobility and upper classes. But what Antonie was not, was a man of the people. Having living a noble life, he shares little in common with the commoners and much of the military, though respectful of his titles and combat skills, fine him insufferable.\nThe second choice, was Sonic the Hedgehog. Young and full of energy, he is seen my many as the face of Acorn’s future. Beyond that, he is a hero. Having spent much of his military career during the Robotnik War not just fighting Badniks but also saving civilians. Though somewhat cocky, Sonic has the adoration of the people and is held in high regards by most military commanders. But, despite his ties to Sally, there are some within the nobility who believe he is getting too close to the common folk.\nBut those were his options: Antonie, the hero of the nobility, or Sonic, the people’s hero. One had to get the sword and earn a place in history forever."

Even at his super speed, Sally could tell that Sonic had rushed to put on his military uniform. Medals were unaligned, patches missing, this was what one expected from a recruit. But neither of the Acorn royals wanted to chastise him, for they had an important matter to address.\n“Hey Sal. Elias, Your Majesty. What’s this about?” Sonic said as he sat down in the chair. Wasting no time, Sally leaned forward.\n“I know how eager you are to get back to front, so we’ll be quick. We’ve been reading your combat reports and-”\n“You’re here to congratulate me! Well I knew it was long overdue.” Sonic interrupted, but his cocky grin was wiped off his face from the glare of Elias.\n“No. These reports have been…less that promising.”\n“What are you talking about?! I’ve been smashing up their tanks and trucks! Tearing up their railways!”\nElias pulled up a folder,“Yes and your kill count has been low. In fact, I have an entire room of witnesses that claim you SAVED some of those revolutionaries from their wrecked vehicles!”\n“Yeah? What’s the problem?”\n“The problem Sonic, is that we can’t just send them back with scrapes and bruises. We need to send them home in…”\n“In body bags.” Said Eliais bluntly. Immedately, Sonic stood up to his feet in shock.\n“What?! You can’t be serious! I’m not a murderer! I smashed loads of Badniks in the last war, but those were machines. You can’t expect me to just go about killing people willy nilly!”\nSally stood up too, looking at Sonic with sympathetic eyes, “I know this is hard for you. But we’re fighting a real war, against soldiers of flesh and blood. Every soldier you send back alive is one more person who can figure out how to kill you. You’re…a very kind person…that’s a trait I’ve always understood, we all applaude that but…victory cannot be achieved without cost.”\n“It’s vital for the war effort that our enemy is destroyed.”\n“War effort?! More like war crime!”\nEliais stood up too, slamming his fist on the table as he growled at Sonic. “The moral high ground isn’t going to feed our citizens, fuel our tanks or load our guns! Every line you refuse to cross is an advantage our enemies will exploit.” Before the Blue Blur could respond, Eliais slid recon photos over to Sonic. The hedgehog closely examined them, they were towns he had recently liberated…but each one was completely ruined. Burned to a crisp. “Ever wondered why we haven’t heard from any of the places you freeded? Because those soldiers you spared came back, knowing exactly where our defences were and burned them to the ground. THAT is what holding back gets us. If you still think we can win with our honour intact then you might as well surrender.”\nThe two royals were silent, waiting for Sonic’s response. He was shaking, barely able to contain his anger, his rage. For a split second, Sally could have sworn she saw a dark aura around him. He tossed the photos back to Eliais and with a look of resolve, sped off toward the front line."

We have looked over your case, and have determined you are guilty of nothing.”\nRobert Frog looked at her in confusion. That confusion only rose higher when the Queen ordered Frog's cell be opened.\n“The kingdom owes you a great debt for the false imprisonments that occurred during the rule of my predecessors,” she said compassionately. “We will do whatever we must to make sure that this never happens again.”\n“I… I don't know what to say, your majesty. I never thought I'd see the day.”\n“You and many others have waited long enough. Now, you are free.”\nRobert walked out of the prison that very same day a free man.

    avi.1.d:0 "Avisla is a young nation full of energy like a young bird flying towards the wind to feel the joy of the most beutiful part of life. The nation born from within imperialist wars celebrates it's freedom, but for how long? \n\nAvisla was one of the first colonies of Pirenian Empire, founded in 2543 and believed to become a base for further colonial expansion. This land is populated by idle tropical birds. It became a favorite place of kings from all over the world. Many trade ships used to stop here to bring several barrels of rum so crews could continue traveling with all sails. Moreover, cheap labor of locals produced a lot of ore and sugar cane for the empire. With piracy spreading in 27 century and escalation of colonial conflicts, Avisla had become a large naval base so massive fleets could stand in local ports. Markets of slaves and armament were developing on this achipelago.\n\nHowever, Pirenian kings' dreams weren't destined to be justified: during the Foolish War of 2710-2718, Overlanders seized the island, and after the Juana Treaty of 2719, Avisla became an Overlander protactorate. The exploitation of locals came much worse then - tropical birds never expected Overlanders to make their lives better than under the boot of Pirenian Empire, and they were punished for their resistance to Overlander troops by massive enslavement and terror for local peasants. This policy resulted in revolts and wars several times, and after the Six Years' War of 2910-2916 the colonial rule of Overlanders had changed. Though Overlanders supressed the rebels, they understood that they could either wipe out the entire Avislan population or give it some freedoms. And they found the compromise: the First aristocratic Republic of Avisla was found. This puppet state was still a cheap supplier of raw materials, but it's existence calmed nationalist sentiments of Avislan people for several centuries.\n\nDuring the Great War 3215-3225, Overlander Empire occupied Avisla again, dissolving the republic and enforcing conscription of locals so they could fill the frontline gaps after severe defeats of 3223. But this desperate measure resulted in another revolt, and the Overlander garrison was soon destroyed by Eco Revolucionario Movement led by José Balaclaro. Unfortunately, the Second Avislan Republic could not last long: in 3226 Robotnik forces attacked the island. Comandante Balaclaro was roboticized and forced to pursue Robotnik's tyrannical policies. That was a time of the highest upturn of guerrilla spirit. Avislan Freedom Fighters waged guerrilla war against their former idealogical leader, and after a brave group of 64 exiled revolutionaries led by comandante Rafael Fusilos had returned from Rethenia, combined forces of Revolutionary Military Council (Consejo Militar Revolucionario) overthrew Robotnik regime and destroyed Balaclaro's robotic body unable to save him. \n\nKatzerist wing of CMR is the most influental and active now, but it's authority is not consolidated yet..."

    egg.intro1.t:0 "The Eggman Empire - part 1"
    egg.intro1.d:0 "Welcome to the Eggman Empire - the realm of progress and rationality! Before you enter our glorious century, let us start with a brief history.\n\nWhen Mobius burst into flames of the Great War, scientific progress opened a new page in the history of the planet. \n\nJulian Kintobor, a great scientist of his time, was a soldier on the scientific front on both sides of the war. Rejected by the ungrateful Overlanders, Dr. Kintobor found his place in the service of His Majesty King Maximilian Acorn. Since then, his military genius has been sent to help the Mobians in their war against the Overlanders. The perfect weaponry created by Julian Kintobor with the help of his faithful nephew Colin Kintobor turned the war and helped the Mobians defeat the Overlanders. Thanks to the Great War, Robotnik was elevated to the rank of Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Army. It was the peak of his power, but King Max got in the way of his aspirations. \n\nYears of war have opened Kintobor' s eyes to the blindness of both Mobians and Overlanders. Their so-called "will" is no more than a set of instincts, and to prevent chaos and destruction, it took a firm hand of such a genius as Kintobor was. After King Max decided to disband the War Ministry, Julian Kintobor realized that there would be no better time to take power. He secretly built an army of robots and on the night between 297 days and 298 days in 3225 he captured Mobotropolis and overthrew the Acorns, sending the king to the Zone of Silence. Alas, Queen Alicia and her little son Elias had managed to flee to Angel Island. Princess Sally also escaped, and was destined to lead the Knothole Freedom Fighters. \n\nSir Charles's invention was in the right hands. The newly proclaimed Emperor Ivo the Robotnik used the Robot to turn disobedient Mobians into obedient robot Robians, deprived of the so-called "will" and following the orders of the Robotnik himself. Of course, like the wild beasts they are, Mobians began to resist. Robotnik's army captured almost all of Mobius, and everywhere began a ruthless war with "Freedom Fighters" groups - rebel groups that undermined the infrastructure of the Robotnik Empire. The most powerful Freedom Fighters group, led by Princess Sally Acorn and Sonic the Hedgehog, operated in the village of Knothole."

    egg.intro2.t:0 "The Eggman Empire - part 2"
    egg.intro2.d:0 "The war that Robotnik went to, lasted a long 10 years. It went down in history as the First Robotnik War. It took far more lives than the Great War. The fate of millions of Mobians was unenviable - complete Roboticization and loss of independent consciousness. Jules the Hedgehog, seriously wounded during the Great War, was the first Robian, but it was a big mistake to leave his child alive. Sonic became a big problem for the Empire, like all other Freedom Fighters. These groups appeared in every corner of Mobius, on the land, in the sky and in the sea.\n\nGradually losing control of the periphery, where local warlords could not cope with the growing resistance of the people, Robotnik also experienced great difficulties in the heart of his Empire. To fight against Knothole Freedom Fighters, Robotnik had to divert significant forces from the outskirts of the Empire, which ironically contributed to the fall of his rule. To end the main threat to his rule, Robotnik implemented one of his old projects - the Ultimate Annihilator. Its use in Operation Endgame was to put an end to all resistance, but the betrayal of Colin Kintobor, known as Snively, led to the wrong triggering of the weapon of retribution - the Robotnik was destroyed instead of Knothole.\n\nIn 3235, the war was over. Although Snively tried to hold on to the rest of the Empire, his power did not last long. Shortly after his uncle's death, he was captured by the Freedom Fighters trying to escape from Robotropolis. The lands devastated by Robotnik were thrown into the abyss of anarchy. The vast expanses of Mobius were uninhabitable, and the wastelands of West Northamer could not be reclaimed even after the fall of Robotropolis.\n\nSnively was able to escape from captivity months later, but fate brought him to the space station of the so-called Robo-Robotnik - as it turned out, it was Robotnik from an alternative reality, who arrived at Mobius Prime to continue his path of conquest. He knew about Snively's betrayal, but gave him one last chance to redeem himself. From the ashes of the Robotnik Empire rose the Eggman Empire - Robotnik assumed the organic body and became known by this very name. The Eggman Empire continued the cause of its predecessor.\n\nThe new year of 3236 meets the Eggman Empire with great difficulties. The successful offensive deep into the Kingdom of Acorn by the actions of Sonic and other freedom fighters turned into a major retreat from all positions. Diversion groups, supervised from Knothole and New Mobotropolis, flooded the lands of the Egman Empire. Eggman's actions in trying to stop the resistance and regain control over the defective Robians only create more problems, and it is not known if the Empire will survive this year..."

As soon as the formation was over, on command they prepared machine guns, flamethrowers, rocket launchers, lasers, and even blades for battle. Then the mechanical soldiers began to comb the area.\n\n"In the last war, they constantly hid from Robotnik." Eggman thought to himself. "But they weren't hiding far... I will lure them out.

But who knew what his experiments with artificial intelligence could lead to this time? \n\nThe peculiarity of Metal Sonic was his ability to scan the vital activity data of his opponents and copy their techniques and even superpowers. But beyond his abilities, Metal Sonic absorbed the thinking of every life form he scanned. Although the basis of his personality was Sonic's own data, the character of this machine was greatly distorted by the impressions of many of the leaders he met. Having the ability to move around Mobius, Metal Sonic faced different personalities, politicians, generals, dictators. Impressed by the horrors of war against the obnoxious Mobius, all these characters mixed with Sonic's vanity and created an uncontrollable monster... \n\nOne day, Metal Sonic revealed his true nature, just as Eggman began to suspect him of disloyalty. If the war had unfolded more successfully for Eggman, he could have kept control over his loyal warrior. But it was too late. Metal Sonic came to the conclusion that his own creator was an obstacle to his personal goals. With these thoughts, the robot broke into Eggman's command center, smashed his guards and captured the scientist himself. Metal Sonic did not dare destroy him, only because the doctor had valuable information with him, but he could not trust his creator anymore. That's why Metal Sonic locked Egman in a cryo chamber, freezing him and taking control of the Empire. Metal Sonic rebuilt himself from all the data he had scanned, taking the form of Neo Metal Sonic.

Snively, who came to the aid of his uncle, did not interfere with the Freedom Fighters. He went up to Eggman and patted his shoulder.\n\n"You didn't beat him this time, Sonic. You BROKE him. Eccentrics aside, he really is a genius... The world fell to his brilliance in a few short years." - he said it grievously. - "And then there's you.

He looked shabby.\n\n“I'm standing in the middle of the battlefield!” the reporter went straight to the point, missing the usual phrases.

"Dr. Eggman's preparation for revenge was completely successful. His forces were able to break the resistance of the Freedom Fighters, which forced the latter to retreat and cease all activity on the territory of the Eggman Empire, which now seems to be ready for war again. Military plants and factories, infrastructure and defensive structures, the increase in the number and quality of troops - everything suggests that neighboring states should mobilize their forces in case of aggression from the Empire. Most likely, this was what guided the units of the Freedom Fighters when they decided to give this battle to the troops of the Eggman Empire.

Outside the fortress, huge metal machines were assembling equipment and building new workshops. The pipes were smoking at the old pace, the huge Tesla coils sparkled with blue tongues, and new cars rolled off the assembly line. Everything was the same, Robotnik thought, but what Snively was telling him made him wonder. In Retenia, the homeland of an absolutely absurd ideology, a new congress was being prepared, on which the future of the country depended. Eggman didn't give a damn about what kind of person would become the head of state, but the number of productive forces in the territory of Retenia and the potential for their growth was worthy of envy. Fortunately, the country was divided and couldn't currently claim world domination. However, their powers were of interest to the Empire. A wonder how many technical innovations and miracles were able to get into the hands of these animals taking advantage of the chaos? How did the pitiful feeling of "victory" spur their arrogance and impudence that they dared to encroach on HIS inventions ?! Within the Acorn Empire itself, opposition to the existing absolutist regime was growing. The situation was similar in the United Federation, where looming political and economic crises risked escalating into large-scale shocks for the Overlander stronghold. In general, the world was distracted for a second from the Black Spot in the west of Northamer, and this definitely played into the hands of Eggman. While organics were sorting things out and fighting among themselves, the Empire would receive precious time for development and military construction:\n\n"In our D.E. Ls, riots and riots are happening more and more. If the leaders make every effort, we can still hold these territories."\n"What about the IronDominion?"\n"Ah, Regina." Snively left the real world for a moment but soon shook and continued. "The Iron Queen is gathering strength and preparing to take control of Shigai."\n“Well, it's not that bad.” Eggman said.\n"That's right, we will quickly recover from defeat..."\n"No." Eggman raised his voice. "There was no defeat. Let's call this a test. Now, after the first attempt at conquest, we understand who our enemy is. First, the dying Acorn dynasty, and second, their pitiful foster-son Sonic!

Anger, strong indignation at what was happening, and at the same time a thirst to join the global game again oozed from Eggman's lips. Yet there was nothing to stop him. "The war happened because of stupidity opposing the inevitable progress... I will say the following. Your activity to prevent the beginning of a new world is a molecular friction against what I plan to implement all over the Mobius. I promise: very soon the whole world will be under my leadership, and my labor will bear not the fruit of war, but the beginning of a new bright era of a prosperous civilization. I promise this, and I have the means to fulfill this promise. The question is: are you ready to accept a bright and inevitable future, or do you decide to fight against it and lose like the scum? Either way, Eggman Empire will be reborn and become so great that nothing can stop it. I'll give you time to think before it's too late.""

That all work is rewarded fairly. They dream about having the benefits of civilization without risk of losing them. About making life safe." Eggman paused for a moment and, in a gesture of benevolence, passed his hand from left to right with his palm up. "All this I guarantee. I solemnly swear that I will do my best to achieve this goal.” Ivo bowed ceremoniously and then straightened, holding a clenched fist to his chest. "In the past, I had the same goal, but many perceived the path to it as something dangerous. I acknowledge that I have had certain mistakes in the past and am willing to change my methods for your benefit. And the first step towards achieving our dream, which I declare: reforms will be carried out." A new pause at the beginning gave rise to several seconds of complete silence, which were replaced by a storm of applause. But everyone was quiet when Eggman gestured for them to let him continue. "The Empire guarantees its citizens the care of their welfare in exchange for obligations of service. Military or labor exploits will give you not only glory, but also quite tangible material benefits, and the achievements of the intellect will be rewarded with a higher status. Diligence, ingenuity, perseverance, discipline, and, most importantly, loyalty and dedication are our virtues that everyone will strive for."\n\nFinally, Ivo Robotnik finished his speech.

But here, Eggman met the blow with dignity, and the hero showed by his appearance that killing the enemy was not a way to prevent the worst, but a main goal in itself. The expression on the hedgehog's face was bloodthirsty, but no more.\n\nAnother flyer. Sonic was depicted surrounded by a whole crowd of girls - Sally, Amy, Bunny, Fiona, and a dozen others. But the hedgehog sorted them out with attention, not making a permanent choice on one and promising love forever to each. And in the same place, at the edge of the leaflet, Tails was shown, painfully looking at the fox, which was dear to his heart, and now argued with her friends about when Sonic will pay attention to her. And Sonic on this leaflet directly said: "Insecurity is freedom, infidelity is dignity, deceit is strength." The editors got the hedgehog to support what the majority of the people attributed to Eggman.\n\nThird leaflet. Sonic took Chao's egg out of the store and said "I couldn't think of anything better to save it than to steal it from an honest man in broad daylight."\n\nFourth leaflet. Sonic ran away from forces who, like him, were wreaking havoc in the city. Cars and pedestrians did not have time to get away from the impact. The hedgehog saw this but still had fun.\n\nSonic himself did not yet know that he would soon meet those who didn't directly believe in these accusations, but would remember various insults inflicted on them or those who were dear to them.

When he returned to the apartment, the situation immediately seemed suspicious - Solid remembered exactly that he had closed the door with both locks, but the chairs and armchairs were clearly out of place. He noticed such things only because they had already happened before and constantly fuel his distrust. However, there was no time to find out the reasons - he had to go to work in the city administration.

Today they were given a small reward - the highest quality lubricant at the expense of the manager. It went only to those who showed exemplary behavior and did not create any problems.

But when the doctor opened the mysterious box, he was horrified to recognize the plastic explosive charge near a group of various transmitters. And, apparently, something went wrong... The explosion was weak, but Locke could not survive it. Kurt panicked and ran away, constantly shouting about how all the legionnaires were made into suicide bombers. Someone looked into the infirmary and spread the news even further. Five minutes later, the whole unit was in a panic. The fighters, convinced of the veracity of the accusations against the authorities, managed to storm the radio booth and activate electronic warfare equipment at all frequencies known to them. The regiment commander, who lost the ability to instantly eliminate all the rioters, had to send military police against them. Mobians and robots in heavy armour, armed with stun guns, spike poles, assault shields and flashbangs, rushed into battle against legionnaires armed only with improvised means and their own enthusiasm. The rioters tried to storm the armoury but were pushed back to the radio booth where they took up defensive positions. Knowing that they wouldn't make it out anyway, they sent a message to everyone: “Eggman made his legionnaires into suicide bombers. Everyone who cares about life, check yourself and block the signals.”\nIn the end, the booth was pelted with tear gas grenades, and all the instigators of the disorder were tied up. But in the rest of the units, it was necessary to strain agitators to expose the true state of affairs for the intrigues of enemy agents. But, of course, it was not possible to convince everyone..."

"Viper, your turn."\n\nFour Egg Vipers and an accompanying link of fighters separated from the group and floated through the air towards the enemy positions. They flew too low for radar to spot them, and when they were spotted by optics, the Viper antiaircraft guns shot down incoming missiles. And the first victim of a retaliatory missile salvo was the very same air defenses that were supposed to stop them. And then long-range howitzers fired at the same coordinates, finishing off the survivors. Having removed the main obstacle, the Vipers began to hover briskly along the strips of fortifications, firing at trenches and armoured vehicles from heavy lasers, and destroying the infantry with small ones. By the time the Imperial soldiers set foot back on the ground, the defenders had already begun to organize a retreat."

There were wrecks of robots around, mostly outdated models, but there were more dead bodies of enemies. The walls were covered with graffiti propagating the ideas of the Freedom Fighters. The signs were also repainted, changing the name of the street to “Free”. The building of the TV station was a miserable sight - one half was on fire, and the other half had already collapsed. The emperor bent down and picked up a flyer from the ground, on which Sonic invited the reader to join the fight.\n\n"Stupid pin cushion..." Eggman assessed his enemy distantly, crushing the sample of enemy propaganda. "We defeated them long ago, but they still don't see it. They crawl out of every crevice like cockroaches and make dirty tricks wherever they can reach. And one has only to swing for a blow for them to scatter like... the very cockroaches."\n“Our troops and intelligence agencies were able to figure out where they were coming from,” Snively decided to help. Eggman silently turned his head towards him and raised an eyebrow in interest. "In all the lands of Northamer still resisting you, there are training bases for saboteurs, where the survivors fled. We could give the task of delivering a covert blow to..."\n“No,” Robotnik interrupted him, throwing out the crumpled piece of paper. "What do you think the cockroaches will do if their nest is destroyed?"\n“Um…” Colin hesitated briefly, not expecting such an unusual question. "Will they run away?"\n"They will make a new one. So your idea will, at best, just delay new forays. And I will not stand it ... We will arrange a general cleaning for them, "Eggman grinned, showing predatory grin. “Our neighbours from the north will pay dearly for their support of these parasites.

Before entering, I slow down to the prescribed speed, so as not to provoke too much attention. I'm hot, and not only because I'm wearing a heavy suit with lead inserts. But I try to calm the excitement - I don't want to screw up at the finish line when I passed the hardest part of the road. Did the partners collect the isotopes piece by piece, carrying them here with great risk, for it to be in vain?\n\nThe view from the cab of my heavy truck was pretty good: simple huts on the outskirts of the settlement turned into sturdy houses, and they were in the trees too, and suspension bridges connected them. Everything around was green, fresh and simply beautiful. A true pastoral idyll. I tried to remember as vividly as possible the sight of this sacrificial lamb because it was me who was to solemnly slay it.\n\nAfter showing my documents - of course, as a Freedom Fighter, I had the proper clearance - I entered the freight elevator. Having dropped a few levels below, I drove a military truck into one of the underground hangars, stopped the car, got out, and closed the gate. Then I climbed into the hoisting crane cockpit and knocked down several containers to barricade the entrance. No one would stop me.\n\nWhen I got back, I opened the back doors of the truck and ignored the voices outside. Climbing inside the powerful exoskeleton for the movers, I opened the lead container whose inside walls were covered with a thick layer of nuclear fuel. Then I took the hidden isotope plates from the walls of the steel containers and placed them in layers in a lead safe. Then I welded the door and made the structure airtight. My bomb was simple and even primitive, but it would work. Towards the end, I felt that I was uncontrollably nauseous, my head seemed to be splitting, my whole body was weakened and it seemed that a fever had begun. Even these lines in a digital journal are hard to write, but I am sure that the signal will pass... Outside they are trying to open the door - either they want to pull the unfortunate man out of the trap, or beat all the crap out of the spy. But I am satisfied. I lived well and I agree to give my life and many others for Eggman and his world. My enemies will hate me with all their hearts, but I don't care. I am pressing the button...

Should the creation of a secret war club where the general and the private do not pay attention to ranks be understood as a useful initiative of the soldiers or as the foundation of a subversive cell? Should the frequent requests for unscheduled exercises be interpreted as a desire to develop their army or as a desire to supply a foreign country with intelligence?

His opponent was just relaxing in the pool now. Not finding it interesting, Eggman switched to the southern part of the continent. Infinite was inspecting his troops and also failed to entertain the bored emperor. Then the camera, after some effort, found Sonic. The hedgehog showed incredible perseverance and diligently studied the textbook on military theory. Eggman considered this a special feat on the part of his main rival but did not observe further.\n\n"In my imagination, it seemed much more fun... Computer, give me control of the nearest battle station and aim the observation satellites at the asteroid belt."\n\nThe picture has changed to a panorama of space with a crosshair in the centre and various icons on the sides. Eggman fired a volley of heavy lasers at a large asteroid, chipping away from it. Then he began to shoot off small fragments, at first methodically, and then with enthusiasm.\n\n"Gotcha!" he exclaimed, noticing that one of the space stones was flying away from the affected area. Focusing the fire on the fugitive, the doctor detonated it too. "A-ha, get a load of this!"\n\nSo he amused himself for the rest of the evening."

Moreover, from the outside, the completed sections looked like the most ordinary hills with their own vegetation.\n\nThe doctor ordered the driver to stop and, leaving the car, went up to one of the officers to accompany him into the bunker. There, hand-held AAMS and ATGMs, large-calibre machine guns, flamethrowers, easel grenade launchers and an 88 mm gun were added to the already seen means of defense.

Without warning, the Mercian fleet was fired upon by anti-ship missiles. One of the escort ships broke in two from a well-aimed hit when its ammunition detonated. Soon, splashes of water at the sides were added to the balls of fire on the decks - homing jet torpedoes found their targets.\n\n"Fire on the enemy!!!"  the vice-admiral commanded. "Shoot down those damned Rethens!"\n\nAnti-aircraft guns and missiles took aim at jet planes, but could not take revenge - their enemies disappeared over the horizon and managed to throw off the tail. And when the fleet wanted to regroup, landing capsules fell from the sky. With a crash, they fell to the decks and poured out dozens of combat robots, forcing the sailors to repel the boarding.

Infantrymen, special forces, gunners, tankmen, motorized riflemen, air defense fighters, combat robots, fighter and attack aircraft pilots, nuclear missile operators, electronic warfare fighters and many other military specialists proudly saluted their emperor, who personally received the parade. And in parallel with this, one of the admirals was honoured to represent the emperor at the naval parade. At the end of the celebration, the orbital cannons, setting up their lasers, neatly carved the face of Robotnik on the pedestal.\n\nBut the celebration did not end there. From noon until nightfall there was a wide variety of entertainment, from a simple feast in the village to a grand banquet with musical and dance numbers in the capital.

Ballistic missiles, having received damage, began to break apart and fall. But, despite all the efforts, two warheads of Eggman's troops still missed.

Then they tested a laser-shocker, and with the help of ionization, it created a plasma channel through which a current of alternating polarity was applied, causing the ammunition rack to detonate in the tank. In the end, a rocket was launched into the remaining combat vehicle, the warhead was a magnetic trap with a portion of antimatter. The tank was naturally split into photons.\n\nBut these were tests of ideal samples that were left by alien races. Imperial designs soon entered the field instead.

After that, the protection was checked using an automatic cannon, a flamethrower, a heavy laser, an anti-tank gun with a cumulative projectile and a high-explosive fragmentation bomb. In all cases, the force field sought to absorb kinetic and thermal energy in order to use it for its own nutrition. It was also found that excess energy was scattered along the field, which could be dangerous.

Formation of the capitalism in Mobian world were met by national-liberationist bourgeois revolutions all around the globe of Mobius. Rethenia became one of the 3210 year "Summer of nations" pioneers. The new Rethenian government pursued the interests of the bourgeoisie by expeling the old aristocracy. Yet Rethenia was not destined to achieve prosperity, because after 5 years the Great War started - the bloodiest armed conflict until that time, in which Rethenia intervened on the side of the Mobian powers in order to control the lands of Soleanna. Brutal war almost bleeded the country. But in the year 3225, the year of the Great war's end, the thunder of Robotnik's Empire roared, appearing as the result of the coup of Julian Kintobor. Rethenian republic tried to confront the Empire, by using an army weakened from the previous war, but its efforts were in vain. In 3228 Stalegor and many other cities were captured by Robotnik and Rethenia capitulated. Only the people, who experienced the horrors of forced robotization, did not give up. In the movement of Rethenian Freedom Fighters converged both right and left-wing forces of the country. The Red Guard of the Freedom Fighters distinguished itself by attacking cities and destroying Robotnik’s proteges, undermining railways and robot factories. During the First Robotnik War, 2 political forces formed: the nationalist RNRP and the socialist RPRA. After Robotnik was expelled from the lands of Rethenia in 3229, the restoration period began. Yet the Coalition government could not solve a single important issue in the face of hunger, huge debts to the United Federation and desolation of agricultural land. \n\nThis led to radicalization of society and the collapse of the coalition. During a strike at the "Arsenal" arms factory, a conflict occurred between the hero of the First Robotnik War, Yuri Pallasov, who headed the avant-garde wing of the RPRA, and General Boris Martynov. This conflict was the starting point for the armed uprising of the proletariat of central Rethenia and the civil war, which took 2 and a half years and cost millions of victims. The Red Army of Rethenia, created by Pallasov and Leona Eismesser, was able to defeat the Supreme Reactionary Forces in 3233, and after the explosion of a cobalt bomb over the last Martynov fortress, the VRS forces surrendered, and Martynov died. Rethenian Council Socialist Republic now stands in the way of implementation of scientific communism principles by Heinrich Katzer, and the prosperity of this country will depend entirely on the efforts of the working class of Rethenia and on the victories of the International, which included Avisla, Hiboulia and Transashia."

Фильм является нескрываемой насмешкой над царящим во многих странах культом Соника, о чем говорит весьма карикатурная внешность Мистера Спидстера - главного героя этой картины. Сюжет фильма строится вокруг приключений Мистера Спидстера, по воле случая попавшего в Сталегор - столицу Ретении. Синий ёж пугает прохожих, убегает от сотрудников КОРТСа и занимается вредительством в сторону социалистичсекой собственности, пока не оказывается пойман одиноким оперативником КОРТС. Но фильм старается быть немного жизнеутверждающим, и поэтому главный герой не только становится другом чекиста, но и осознает ошибочность своих жизненных приоритетов. В конце фильма Мистер Спидстер становится Товарищем Быстроходовым и побеждает доктора Механизмова в неравной схватке при поддержке своих новых друзей и бригады пролетариев. \n\nФильм получил неоднозначные оценки в обществе. Мало кто из граждан страны Советов может оспорить идею этого фильма, но всех, особенно детей, напугала графическая составляющая и облик главного героя. Через неделю после начала проката фильма зафиксировано 148 обращений в психиатрические больницы, в каждом из которых были заметны последствия просмотра этого фильма. Пластикоподшипников, один из выдающихся архитекторов направления неоконструктивизма, заявил, что такое кино опасно показывать детям.

В центре заговора, по данным председателя КОРТСа Николая Колючкина, стоит Геннадий Шилов - командир 2 армии, штаб которой размещается под Сталегором. Помимо Шилова, в заговоре задействованы 24 офицера, ученых и даже партийных деятелей. В условиях накаляющеся политической обстановки в ожидании VII Съезда Советов возможный путч может стать искрой, которая может уничтожить страну Советов в пожаре новой гражданской войны, и допускать подобное не в интересах рабочего класса Мобиуса. \n\nКорни конфликта уходят еще во времена Гражданской Войны, которая закончилась 3 года назад. Шилов тогда возглавлял милитаристскую оппозицию, которая была недовольна "злоупотреблениями" декретом о национальном самоопределении бывших национальных окраин Ретенской Республики. Так же Шилов выражал возмущение тем, что мы до сих пор пускаем на смерть живых мобинцев, когда, по недавнему открытию его сподвижника, - профессора Павла Угрюмова, - возможно было роботизировать павших бойцов и отправить их первыми эшелонами. А в целом, Шилов регулярно обвинял и продолжает обвинять наше руководство в мягкотелости по отношению к возможным внешним врагам. \n\nКолючкин предлагает для обеспечения безопасности немедленно арестовать всех задействованных в заговоре и всех заподозренных. Очевидно, что агрессивные меры могут послужить толчком к началу масштабных чисток в Красной Армии, что может ослабить её командование. Но во имя безопасности РССР на такие меры можно пойти. Или попробовать найти с Шиловым компромисс в силу того, что Палласов знает все причины конфликта с этим офицером и может попробовать мирно договориться с Шиловым."

И именно поэтому командарм поставил Палласову условия, на которых он прекратит контрреволюционную деятельность: развитие программ роботизации, предоставление Шилову должности заместителя наркома военного дела после VII Съезда Советов и продолжение разработок военных планов экспорта Революции. Все равно большая часть его идей может стать актуальной в будущем, когда наша страна пройдет необходимую модернизацию.

The triumph of the forces of the Revolution over internal reaction only opened a new page in the history of class war, when Rethenian proletariat can decide where should he go further along the road to the victory of socialism. Society is opened to the unpaved field of new solutions and ideas, and any independant party activist had his vision, and the end of the civil war only incited the factional element in the ranks of the party that were forming during the war. \n\nThe first intra-party conflict, which put the ruling RPRA on the brink of a split, was outlined in connection with the outcome of the Hussar conference on March 27, 3231. \n\nThe more weakly the threat of the Gray Army seemed, the more cruel the dictates of the vangurad party seemed. Against the backdrop of the Sinitsyn unrest in May 3233, the Khnykin-Lisitsin-Borotbytko group issued a “letter of seventeen” in which they demanded a relaxation of pressure on both the rural population and workers, as well as criticized the vanguardist artists for violating the principles of workers' democracy. This was one of the reasons for easing the RPRA policy for the next three years. Approximately at the same time, feuds reached the ranks of the Red Army, when Shilov and his comrades from the "fifth division" started a discussion about the urgent need for reform in the army and the continuation of the war with the capitalist countries. Shilov’s defeat in the discussion provoked him to conduct activities in secret from the People’s Commissariat of Defense. \n\nAt the VI Congress of Soviets, which is also known as the "first post-war Congress", the majority was won by the vanguardist faction, but this victory was overshadowed by the sudden elimination from the political life of the elected chairman Pallasov due to the exacerbation of the "magnetic syndrome" - a side effect of the excessive use of magnetic abilities of his body, superimposed on nervous exhaustion during the years of the First War of Robotnik and the Civil War, chained Pallasov to a hospital bed. The Vozhd of the Revolution spent half a year in the hospital, while in his absence and under the conditions of the decayed state security services, internal party discussions, rampant bureaucratization and stagnation of the economy, were formed prerequisites for the final split of the RPWV. On his 33rd birthday on December 28, 3235, Yuri Pallasov returned from the sanatorium, and now he gazes upon the chaos in the party. Will he be able to restore order, or even the intervention of the Vozhd of the Revolution will not be able to save the situation?"

Начавшийся утром 21 марта показательный процесс над командармом Фёдором Шубиным, бывшим председателем ВЦИК Леоной Айсмессер и группой их сторонников, он вызывал бурную реакцию в обществе. Даже такие известные враги авангардистов, как Николай Хныкин, выступили с протестом против политизированного суда, итог которого был очевиден еще до начала заседания. Но какое дело Шилову, красному офицеру и спасителю Революции, до мнения кабинентных экономистов, строящих интриги в профсоюзах? \n\nК полудню, во время выступления Геннадия Шилова со свидетельствами причастности товарища Шубина к убийству Палласова якобы по заказу Айсмессер, председательствующий суда Владислав Андреев упал без сознания. Пользуясь отвлеченностью Военной коллегии внезапным происшествием, в ходе которого Андреев скончался от смертельного отравления, в зал суда ворвались оперативники КОРТС, застав врасплох и разоружив охрану. Выстрелами в потолок чекисты заставили лечь лицом в пол практически всех присутствующих, а стоять остался лишь Шилов. Он же увидел, как прямо перед его глазами через распахнутые двери входит Николай Колючкин, председатель КОРТСа. Товарищ Колючкин требует прекратить это "позорное заседание", но Шилов попытался оказать сопротивление, выхватив свой пистолет. За это он был застрелен Колючкиным на месте. \n\nДраматическая разязка в зале суда сопровождалась массированными облавами в разных городах РССР, в ходе которых арестовывались и увозились якобы на допрос многие партийные деятели. В течение следующих 24 часов многие из них были расстреляны, а профессор Угрюмов, известный как верный сторонник Шилова, был повешен в Сталегоре. Подавленное после часов пыток шиловцами Айсмессер не позволило ей оказать какое-либо сопротивление, а Шубин, как личный друг Колючкина, отказался противиться его приказаниям. Утром 23 марта Колючкин официально вступил в должность председателя ЦК РПРА, а затем и в должность председателя Совнаркома. Оправдывая захват власти, он предал общественности комропмат на Шилова, как настоящего виновника убийства Палласова. Теперь, когда Колючкин сконцентрировал в своих руках всю полноту государственной власти, он намерен "отомстить всем реакционерам, стоявшим за контрреволюционными бандами Шилова".

Это первый съезд, на котором о себе заявили сразу две оппозиционные фракции, и, кроме того, по правилам на каждый нечетный съезд ставится вопрос о переизбрании ВЦИКа и СНК РССР. В первый же день 500 делегатов наполнили зал заседаний, а Учредительная Комиссия Съезда Советов торжественно объявила о начале выборов. Перед началом голосования каждый кандидат представил делегатам программу своей фракции. Лидирующая фракция будет предопределять законодательные акты, выносить внешнеполитические решения, определять вектор государственного планирования и иметь преимущество в осуществлении других функций. \nПервым выступил товарищ Палласов, нынешний председатель Совнаркома и член ЦК РПРА. Юрий Александрович обещал не только сохранение принципов катцеризма, но и будущее продолжение социалистического строительства на базе форсированных автоматизации, роботизации и коммунализации всей экономики. Кроме того, товарищ Палласов гарантировал, что РССР не даст угаснуть пламени Мировой Революции и приведет рабочих всего Мобиуса к победе над капиталистами. Культурная революция, уничтожающая старый быт и создающая нового, готового к коммунизму мобианца.\nСледующим выступил эпатажный товарищ Кругин, призвавший обратиться к историческому прошлому Ретении в деле строительства социализма на основе национальной культуры. Не отменяя лидирующей роли плана в народном хозяйстве и настаивая на форсированном развитии производства, Кругин настаивал на сохранении традиционных ценностей. В его планах - превращение Советской Ретении в сверхдержаву, объединившую Юрашию под своим знаменем. \nНаконец, место на трибуне занял товарищ Хныкин. Он убеждал делегатов в том, что социализм - это прежде всего борьба за освобождение личности, а социалистические преобразования произойдут через мирную интеграцию мелкой буржуазии в социалистическое общество. В приоритетах - пацифистская внешняя политика, строительство синдикалистской экономики, развитие личных прав и прав меньшинств. \nНачинается борьба, в которой победителем может быть только один...

И сегодня товарищ Палласов на очередном пленуме ЦК РПРА выступил с очередным заявлением, в котором он обрушился с критикой на партийный "дресс-код". В конце своего обращения он объявил одежду пережитком классового общества, которому не место в социалистическом будущем. Кроме того, он отметил, что необходимость в ношении одежды очень скоро отмирает в связи с развитием производительных сил общества. Наконец, Палласов напомнил, что многие мобианские мужчины и женщины уже не носят одежды, не страдая ни от общественного порицания, ни от холода. \n\nСерьезность намерений товарища Палласова поняли, когда он на глазах у товарищей сорвал с себя френч и выкинул всю одежду в окно. Партийцы были вынуждены воспринимать это серьезно из-за присутствоваших в зале лояльных вождю солдат. С его приказов по всей стране прошли демонстрации против ношения одежды, когда та признавалась буржуазным пережитком и унылым декадентством. Лишь солдаты и рабочие крайне опасных производств не были задействованы в этой кампании, но показательные марши голых граждан привели буржуазную прессу и отечественную интеллигенцию в ужас."

The Union of Socialist Robotics offered its assistance in organizing industrial, agricultural, and domestic robot halls, while a group of 16 nuclear physicists insisted on demonstrating the importance of nuclear power for the national economy. Finally, the chairman of the Academy of Sciences of the RCSR Viktor Gromov took the public initiative to expand the exhibition to industrial and scientific topics. \n\nTheir requests were satisfied, and the project of the exhibition was named "The Exhibition of the Achievements of Rethenian Workers" (VDRT).

Seven pavilions were already available to visitors on the opening day, and another 24 pavilions are planned to be opened in the future, along with an amusement park, a summer garden and the first experimental smart house. The opening ceremony was attended by Chairman Pallasov himself, Comrade Eismesser, Comrade Shubin and Academician Gromov, and delegations from Avisla, Transashia and Hiboulia were invited.

This group of specialists was nicknamed "mechanists" by the people. Mechanists organized communes, trained peasants to work with advanced equipment and demonstrated its work in practice. Party activists demonstrated the unity of the people and the party to the peasant masses, and the ravaged peasants, seeing the communalization as a prospect of victory over poverty and landlessness, were much less afraid to join the communes.

A small and ruined peasant wants more of his land, but a firmer peasant does not want to give it to society. \n\nThe RPRA sees only one way to resolve these contradictions. A revolution in all agriculture is necessary. Private farms must be expropriated, enlarged, and turned into highly productive enterprises with an industrial labor organization and an urban welfare system. By the easy thought of theorists and teleologists, this policy was called "communalization". \n\nVladimir Shchukin, 68 years old rooster, was awakened by a phone call. The frightened elderly man with a quick step of his limping legs reached the other end of his modest village house with a tilted porch. \n\n"Good mo'ning, and wat do ya need?" - grandpa Vovka asked, scared a bit. Someone from a local party organization called, and he called the only villager capable of typing. \n\n"Comrade Shchukin, I need your help in updating the land cadastre," the secretary of the party cell replied. It sounded suspicious enough, but the work required a quick report. Life in the village of Sosnovki would change forever on that day, as it did in tens of thousands of other villages in the country of Soviets."

    rcr.52.d:0 ""The next plenary session of the Central Committee of RPRA was dedicated to the issues of the state structure of the RCSR. The offensive of the Vanguardist faction continued, and no one could stop it. The speeches of the Pallasov’s opponent with the party became louder and more desperate. One after the other, members of the opposition spoke. Nationalists and autonomists now acted as if they were looking for the way to victory over the common enemy in the alliance. \n\nPallasov listened to the factionists' speeches with a mood like a wild cat, who was about to bring its clawed paw over a rat. Comrade Eismesser, who sat to the left of the Chairman, gave exactly this comparison. She wrote that Pallasov was ready to gobble everyone who somehow tried to influence the party line at one glance. He perceived the party line as something inviolable for the elements hostile to Katzerism. All that could keep him from aggression was to go to Comrade Shubin's address. \n\n"Comrades, - Shubin began his appeal, rising above all as the highest member of the Central Committee, which had an unfazed calm, - workers of Shilovograd Electrotechnical Plant write me letters. I, as a worker, cannot leave my brothers' voices unheard. \n\nThe Hero of the Civil War brought to the Central Committee the collective complaints of workers against the workers' control bodies. The actual sabotage of production came from both the factory management and the corrupt members of the workers' inspection. The whole story came down to a disappointing but important requirement: it was necessary to put an end to both the bureaucratic arbitrariness in the field and the anarchy of government in the state. \n\nAfter that, the word was given to Comrade Pallasov. He criticized the factionists, accusing them that one part of the opposition aspired to anarchy in governance, the other to bureaucratization of the party and state. \n\n"In this regard, I propose to put to a vote a resolution.” - the Chairman concluded on this. This resolution was adopted by voting - the party, the working control bodies, and the governing bodies of Soviets were subject to reorganization. Rabkrin's powers were expanded, the factions lost the right to present their program, and the principle of work of state institutions was brought in conformity with the principles of democratic centralism.""

Vostokograd committee of the RKP made a report, which couth the lack of products from one third to half for each reporting position. Much more deplorable situation is observed in regional centers, towns, and villages of smaller size. Many villages are surviving by subsistence farming, unable to purchase food and necessities at their own expense. Representatives of the Far Eastern Railway tried to convince us with their notes that the loss of goods associated with technical difficulties, delays, accidents, congestion of the railway system. \n\n"Serpovets A700" car, the official price - seventy thousand tselkovys. Comrade Shpalin has refined tastes in cars". - Nikolay Koliuchkin noted with irony, looking through the documents on the table in front of Comrade Pallasov. The clock was ticking, and the Pallas’s cat continued to think with a gloomy face how such personalities could find themselves in strategically important organs. \n\n"If this is a hint to detain and estimate the value of his property, I give you the green light. The main thing is for you to be sure that it is necessary, Comrade Koliuchkin," concluded the chairman, stirring sugar in a cup of caramel tea. - "Probably, he also knows better about tea than I do". \n\nThe inspection of Shpalin's apartment and the inventory of his property did not even take an hour, and already so much information was opened that it was enough for more than one volume of materials. A whole corrupt network opened up, in which more than a hundred people were involved, but hacked correspondence indicates that 22 executives responsible for the movement of freight trains, organized theft and sale of goods through intermediaries, whose names were also quickly identified. All involved persons were arrested and taken to Stalegor for a show trial. Comrade Pallasov, who was present at the trial, remained cool until he was given his word. \n\n"Comrades, such criminal acts are symptoms of the disease that hit our state machine. This case should initiate real personnel purges and serve all other lessons that the Council authorities do not tolerate careerism and bureaucratic arbitrariness.

Many scientists were forced to flee the capital, scattering around the country, and the flames of civil war forced them to leave the country altogether. Some have been roboticized, and their fate is now unknown. Some of the scientists who collaborated with Robotnik either fled to the Empire or met their punishment in front of firing squads. Hardly half of the former faculty managed to recover, not to mention the destruction of infrastructure and academic buildings of the university itself. \n\nRebuilding and renovation of the University were an initiative of academician Gromov, supported by comrade Eismesser. Invitations were sent out to outstanding Rethenian specialists abroad, with appeals to return home and help the development of national science. To smooth out the fear of possible purges motivated by memories of the Civil War; the letter provided a sharp critical analysis of the former policy of the Academy of Sciences of the RCSR. This letter was signed by 112 professors and academicians, including Viktor Gromov himself. \n\nThe letter was publicly shown. It had an effect rather quickly, and many luminaries of science began to return. The completion of the restoration and opening of 6 new educational buildings was a national holiday. \n\n"Comrades, on behalf of the Council of People's Commissars and the RKP Politburo, I thank all those present, thank all those who have contributed to the birth of new science,” Comrade Pallasov made a speech at the meeting on the opening of the University buildings. \n\n"And I want to thank the party that until this day at least some of my colleagues have survived,” in a joking manner, Gromov started, causing laughter and applause. - “In front of us lies an unpaved land, you might say, covered with the dust of oblivion. We have lost so many years, surviving in a whirlwind of turmoil. But I assure you that I am ready to do everything to make up for the development of national science, not only to catch up with what has been lost, but also to break out ahead. I urge my colleagues to unite around this task.” \n\nThe foundation of The Research Institute of Applied Nuclear Physics at Stalegor University became a highlight of the program. The official part of the event included lectures by the Institute's leadership, as well as by some professors. \n\n"We have met the deadline, Comrade Chairman,” the nuclear physicist said, following Pallasov and the government delegation to the underground levels of the Institute. Only Pallasov and some other persons knew what was waiting for them and one could understand the indescribable surprise of the others when they were shown a nuclear reactor operating at full capacity, put into operation and launched only a couple of days ago..."

With all due respect to Comrade Pallasov, military studies and participation in party affairs are badly combined ...". \n\n"Didn't you say that wit and discipline are what makes our soldier invincible? We have discipline in our party”, - objected Akim, the commander of the guard unit. - "A party soldier must cope no worse than an ordinary villager.” \n\n"But the party wants to make them first-class warriors, let us say, "knights of the revolution”. This sounds ridiculous, and in my opinion, it sounds like a propaganda task, nothing more. I am a professional, not a propagandist. Anyway, I, who wholeheartedly supports our military science, agree to supervise your program. I will teach you everything that I can or cannot do myself,” Kunduzov summed. Akim's eyes sparkled with joy, the feeling that the Robian officer could not experience himself. \n\nSome time later, drills at the training ground near Yozhingrad showed what party recruits are capable of. Many of them had already been involved in the civil war and knew the basics of tactical training. Veteran soldiers patronized the very new recruits at the orders of Kunduzov, which strengthened the spirit of brotherhood and responsibility in the troops. Studying the military science carefully, the soldiers perfectly fulfilled the standards, and to the final exercises they successfully completed all the training tasks, capturing the enemy's headquarters and with the help of captured opponents’ weapons destroyed the tank fleet and the airfield. Comrade Shubin, who was present at the exercise, highly appreciated the combat training, and at the final ceremony he personally presented awards to all the outstanding ones. Shelepenko and Kunduzov were awarded medals "For Excellence in Training”. The exercise was broadcasted nationwide, accompanied by popular electronic music and impressive special effects. Most of all TV viewers remembered the happy faces of the "communards" who completed the training camp, who did not hesitate to embrace each other as brothers right after the combat episode. The show performed by the party figures showed all residents of our country that the possibilities of Mobians are limitless, and the Red Army can help them realize their best qualities, at the same time glorifying them."

Viktor Gromov was stroking the feathers on his head, amazed that he was on his way to his third plenary session of the day. This day he realized that he should have been afraid of his desires after all. He told Pallasov a lot about the prospects of cybernetics, managed to get Eismesser interested in the questions of artificial intelligence. And when it was time to get down to the real project in practice, even this cold-hearted genius was seized with excitement. He was not an economist, but he was to be at the helm of the most ambitious economic project in Rethenian history. Fantasy, nonsense, utopia - numerous people at home and abroad lashed out with criticism at the new project to automate the economy, which was compared to Robotnik's plans in scale and depth of impact. Would Council Rethenia succeed in crossing a new frontier in planning, overcoming the former anarchy of production? \n\nThe crow didn't notice how he almost bumped into a stately male hare. He stumbled back and almost bowed to the academic, addressing him with a tone full of anticipation: \n\n"Victor Georgievich, greetings! I was assigned to your institute just today...", began the hare, shyly lowering his voice. \n\n"Sent to me? Alright, but would you mind introducing yourself?", the raven immediately countered with a condescending tone, adjusting his pince-nez. \n\n"I'm Khariton Ionovich Dryadovich, Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, but right now I'm more of an economist." \n\n"So it was you who won the Hiboulian Prize in Economics a month ago, right? So you're supposed to be at the plenary session, which is the other way around," Viktor said in the end, puzzled, pointing in the other direction. The hare was not yet oriented in the premises of the Institute, but soon the colleagues had quickly taken the right course. Professor Dryadovich's appearence lifted Gromov's spirits: he had no doubt that with such a person they would be able to accomplish a lot, because Dryadovich himself was famous for his methods of solving the most complex economic and mathematical optimization problems. The plan to create an electronic system for socialist economic planning seemed absolutely serious, but it didn't bother the academic anymore, because he understood that the best minds in Soviet Retenia would certainly be on his side."

And she was clearly not happy with his intervention in her business. \n\n“What do you think?” He said calmly as he drank his whiskey. \n\n“Mph.” She said before looking up, “Do you really think you can tighten the leash on me?” \n\n“I simply want to bring down-” \n\n“‘Local bureaucratic arbitrariness’, yes I can read it here.” Ilsa interrupted, “So cut the bullshit and give me a straight answer.” \n\nHe shrugged and downed the rest of the whiskey, “Alright. What we want is centralisation, a stronger state is better able to defend itself.” \n\n“You came all the way out here just to do that?” \n\n“Only because you won’t return my calls.” \n\n“I have better things to do than listen to someone like you talk about ‘Centralisation’.” \n\nHe rolled his eyes, “Trust me I’d rather do this over the phone too. Contrary to your beliefs, this frozen wasteland is not the center of my universe. I also have better things to do.” \n\n“Hmph, regardless give me one good reason why I should sign your damn paper.” She said, tapping the documents she had been given. \n\n“Simple, listening to us can grant you some benefits. More resources, more funding, more wine. I’m sure you’d find that useful.” \n\n“I get plenty of that already.” \n\n“Hmph...I’d have thought you’d only want the best. I guess the Tigress of the North is quite tame after all. Unable to handle a simple document that would have granted you more effective means of performing your...work.” \n\nShe chuckled, “you think that will work?” \n\n“Nope. But if you can’t handle it you can’t handle it.” \n\n“None of your business, now would you mind if we dealt with the matter we discussed earlier.” \n\n“Oh I’d be happy to do that, just sign this.” He offered a sheet of paper, “It makes sure the nature of this meeting is not discussed and the details are agreed upon.” \n\nIlsa took the paper and signed it, with an uninterested look on her face before offering it back. “There, now can we get on with-” Shilov smirked, a chuckle exited his throat, it was a huge gamble but he got what he wanted. Upon realising what she had just done, Ilsa couldn’t help but smirk. “Well played Shilov.” \n\n“Now...about the matter we discussed on the drive here?” \n\nIlsa looked over at the clock, once the hand reached the hour, she replied to him."

The kind you’d find in a poem about the countryside. They’d barricaded all the doors, had enough food for months, the works. So we decided to play it clever, one of the men under my command was a Robian, they were much more of an unknown quantity to people living in this area. We sent him over, unarmed with a white flag and told them he was there to negotiate. As soon as he entered, as per my instruction, he said ‘self-destruct mode activated’, his eyes glowed as he started to vibrate. Within a minute every single one of them had climbed out of the windows and had leapt into a nearby ditch. They almost got away again because we laughed so much.” \n\nIlsa couldn’t help but chuckle at that story, she didn’t realise how much she had in common with Koliuchkin. \n\n“But what about you?” \n\nShe also searched her memories before finally coming up with an answer. “20. Though my story is far shorter. We’d gotten word of counter-revolutionary bandits in the forest and sent some teams to investigate. But we could not find anyone due to how well hidden they were. So we waited until one of them slipped up, we captured him and I...presuaded him to tell us where they were hiding. Within a week they had all been rounded up. Most were sent here but the rest were removed. I will say the executions took longer than I would have expected.” \n\nKoliuchkin nodded, “I’ve faced the same issue. If you want to save on bullets here’s a tip. Tie two of them together, shoot one and knock the body into the river. The other will be dragged under and drown.” \n\nShe nodded, “I’d never thought of that. Normally I just line them up and use one bullet.” \n\n“Not a bad idea, but there’s no guarantee that the bullet will go through multiple bodies.” \n\nIlsa gave an agreeable shrug, “Fair enough. As much I would like this conversation to continue, I believe we do have important matters to attend to?” \n\nKoliuchkin nodded and offered her the paper, she signed it without a second thought before handing it back.

On their way out, they accepted helmets with laser-engraved red letters "R S S R" from the hands of Uglyov, a Robian - he was the first Robian to survive a space flight. He wished a good flight to all the cosmonauts. \n\nWere the first living Rethenian cosmonauts afraid of going into space? They had already heard Uglyov's stories about what he experienced while aboard the spaceship. To be precise - he didn't feel anything, since he was no longer a living Mobian. He was launched into space to check the technical readiness of the ship for the flight, which was then intended for live Mobians. In the minds of aviators who had survived the Great War, the Robotnik invasion, and the Civil War, space did not seem anything too frightening after these stories. There were no enemies in space, and the jolting inside the ship was not critical according to Uglyov's words. They had been instructed that their lives could be cut short, but subconsciously the aviation veterans treated it as just another training flight. \n\n"Blowdown... Drain key... ignition..." - cyclogram commands came one after another from Roman Khazanov himself, who was in teleconference with the cosmonauts.

From a safe distance, the astronauts videotaped the space colony ARK and even launched several small reconnaissance drones from the ship directly to the sinister and mysterious human legacy. Having successfully accomplished their mission, the "Avrora-1" crew landed 12 hours later at 33 kilometers north of Shilovograd, from where they were immediately sent to Stalegor, where even the Chairman greeted them with celebration.

The world we live in is cold and heartless, something we can work so hard to build can be taken from us unfairly and unjustly. You have all learnt this lesson as your former ruler took everything from you, for me it was the day my brothers in arms were slaughtered and betrayed by the corrupt bureaucrats of the United Federation. Today, we will honor their sacrifice! Remember as they gave everything to set me on the path to liberate you all from Kamil! From this day forward we will remember my former comrades! Today we remember Jackal Squad!" \n\nAs soon as he finished talking, the crowd cheered and chanted in unison..."

Infinite approached the cowering Mobian, gesturing for his guards to leave the room. As soon as they locked the door behind themselves, Infinite stood up, removing the handgun he always kept in his poster and loading it. As the cowering Mobian before him expected nothing but death from him, the Jackal surprised him by tossing the handgun on the ground in front of him. \n\n“Go ahead, make the world a ‘better place’.” - commanded Infinite with a devilish smirk. With a pulse of adrenaline, the Dissenter grabbed the pistol, aimed it at the jackal’s forehead and fired.\n\nThe tyrant’s body became distorted and transparent as the bullet harmlessly passed through, small red pixel-like cubes appeared around his body as another Infinite materialized next to him, appearing to be surrounded by the same distortions as the first. Infinite cackled as the Dissenter kept firing, each bullet spawned more and more copies. They all marched towards him laughing in perfect unison. \n\n“You cannot kill us! We are more than Legion! We are INFINITE!” \n\nThe poor Mobian subjected to this cried out of fear and rage as they closed in, he looked down at the pistol in his hand and checked its ammo count. One bullet left. With tears flowing down his face, unable to bear the unkillable Jackal’s taunts, he held it up to his head, screamed as loud as he could and pulled the trigger. \n\nInfinite looked down at the corpse of his first test subject as the illusions vanished, he took the now empty handgun from his grip and wiped off the blood. When the guards returned to dispose of the body, Infinite looked at the glowing Ruby is his possession and smirked."

Raids from Jackalstan into Bharatsha were not unheard of, but nothing quite like this had been attempted before. The team’s explosives expert checked the detonator one last time as the noise of a large train approached them. Looking ahead they saw as it got closer and closer into position. The commander held up his hand, as they got ready to detonate the explosives. \n\n“Steady...steady…” \n\nThen the front cart was inches from the spot and the commander gave his orders, “Now! Blow that train sky high!” The commandos nodded as the detonator was activated, a loud explosion ripped the front car to shreds, sending its trains flying. The other boxcars quickly derail and fell to the sides sporadically. They slammed onto the ground, sending sand up into the air along with the guards. \n\nWith a smirk, the commander nodded for the commandos to move in as the snipers stayed behind. The few defenders that were not killed outright by the explosion or crash tried desperately to organize and fight back, a few even managed to fire upon the commandos. But they were either picked off by snipers or shot by the commandos. They approached one of the boxcars, shooting the lock off and opening it.

But once their eyes had adjusted, they all could see the cheering crowds gathered around the station. Each citizen had a bright happy smile on their face, many waved the flags of Jackalstan as a sign of patriotism.\nThe Corp members smiled and waved too at the crowds, basking in the glory they received. With bags slung over their shoulders, they stepped off the platform, at long last, their feet touched the warm concrete floor of Jacklstan rather than the cold prisoner camps of the RCSR. As they all waved and smiled, each of them made their way to an awaiting transport.\nAfter entering the door was closed and locked behind them as they were taken for some rest. While they were needed on the frontlines, it was clear they could all use some time to recuperate. They looked at each other, now they were more than a unit, they were survivors.

    inf.103.d:0 "The Bharatshian mathematician sat tied to a chair, a single dim light bulb illuminated the room. The chair he sat in was cold and uncomfortable, his bindings were tight, with the rough rope practically carving into his skin. He looked up at his captors, two Jackalstan soldiers, both glared at him like he’d eaten the last doughnut in the box but that doing so was an act of treason. He did not know what they wanted, he wasn’t a rebel or a traitor, the war was over. He just wanted to move on.\n"So, are you willing to comply and to answer our questions Mr. Knight?”\n“What the fuck do you want from me?! I’m a maths teacher for god’s sake, I work at the university, I have all the permissions and permits. What do you want to know?! How to learn Algebra?!”\n“No,” One of them grabbed a folder and opened it, showing Knight its contents. “Explain this. We found it searching your apartment, is this some kind of resistance code?!”\nKnight could not fault them for not understanding what was in the folder. To anyone who wasn’t trained, they’d think it was just some spy code or gibberish. But it was no such code, that would be easy to explain. No this was a formula.\n"That isn’t a code, that’s a formula!”\nThe two Jackals looked at each other, “A formula?”\n“Yeah, it’s a mathematical formula.”\n“For what exactly?! Calculating trajectories for missiles?! Or how to make explosives even bigger?!”\nKnight shook his head, “No. It’s about partitions”\n“And what are those?”\nKnight coughed loudly as he tried to speak, “Well...for example, there are five ways to add up the number 4. 1+1+1+1, 2+1+1, 3+1, 2+2 and 4. This means it has five partitions. With that formula, you can put in any number and you’ll get all the partitions.”\nThe two soldiers looked at each other, then back at him. “You came up with this? On your own?”\nHe shrugged, “More or less.”\nOne of the jackals immediately grabbed his radio, “Give me a minute.” He spoke into the radio, leaving the room as he did. The other soldier seemed amazed that such work could be figured out so effectively by someone from a conquered land.\n“Are you a genius or something?”\nKnight chuckled weakly, “I’m not quite that but...I have always been good with numbers.”\nThe other soldier entered, radio still in hand, “Could this formula be reworked to aid in other ways? Say...plug in a set of criteria for a number and figure out what it is?”\nHe thought for a minute before answering, he knew his answer could mean life or death. “I suppose, but not this exact formula. But perhaps something similar to it, reworking it would take time. Months if not years.”\nThe soldier nodded and spoke into his radio, “He says yes but it will take a while...are you sure?... Alright, I’ll let him know. Out.” He put away the radio and walked behind Knight, cutting off his bindings. The prisoner stretched his arms, rubbing his wrists as he sighed. It felt like bliss.\n"Thank you.”\n“Mr Knight…”"

    inf.104.d:0 "The commander stood anxiously, twiddling his thumbs as he waited for the door to open. Earlier that day he had received a message from the Capital, while the inspection of his troops was nothing new, the one who was leading it was. Infinite himself.\nHe wanted to leave a good first impression so he could perhaps be promoted. Before he could do one last quick check, the door opened. And he strode right in like he owned the place, which technically he did. The commander rose from his chair and offered Infinite a handshake.\n“Sir, it’s such an honour to-”\n“Your men.” He interrupted, “Where are they?”\nWith those words, the commander gulped nervously and gestured to the courtyard. “Right this way, I apologise if I seem nervous.”\nAs the pair behind to head outside, Infinite reassured him. “Do not worry. Such a reaction is natural.” The door opened and the pair stood atop a large balcony, looking down at the courtyard, where the soldiers stood. In rows and columns that would measure a perfectly straight line.\n“Now I hope that the reputation your men hold is accurate.”\n“Of course it is sir! Allow me to demonstrate.” He nodded at the men in the courtyard and they began their exercises.\nThe soldiers immediately began to demonstrate their skills. The first was with a simple marching drill, executed flawlessly with an also robotic level of precision. Already Infinite’s attention began to grow as he was curious as to how the rest of it would go. As part of the drills, they then performed a series of bayonet strikes and melee hits with their rifles. While they had no target in front of them, instead of hitting thin air, they were hitting the critical points of where their target would be. Following this, they all aimed their rifles over the shoulder of the comrades in front of them and opened fire. Each soldier maintained a stoic and serious face, a few of them blinked but that just meant there was room for improvement. Once their guns dried up, they turned to face the balcony and went into the ‘at ease’ stance.\nNow that his men’s demonstration was complete, the commander looked over at Infinite. “Well...what do you think sir?”\nInfinite stayed quiet for a second, before giving his response."

    inf.105.d:0 "The Jackal rested in his railway cart, after the completion of his conquest of Bharastsha he had decided to inspect the new land he’d ‘acquired’. The sunlight coated his body as he took a sip from the glass of whiskey he had in his possession. He let out a sigh, remembering his old comrades back when he worked for G.U.N. What he wouldn’t give for them to be here.\n“Sir?” Asked Keliska as the train began to grind to a halt. “We’re here.”\nInfinite nodded and stood up, heading over to the observation cart and looking through the glass into the town. It was a vast environment, the sunlight beautifully illuminated the architecture. Numerous temples, palaces and monasteries from forgotten chapters of Bharatshian history. Each one was pale white with large onion-like domes on the top, surrounded by numerous lakes and small gardens. Each tended to by monks and local volunteers.\n“Tell me about this place.”\nKeliska nodded and looked through her files. “The town is known as Chandaan, it was the capital of over 13 Bharatshian kingdoms in the past. Chandaan is largely intact due to the fighting having not reached here before capitulation and the lack of valuable strategic targets. While not the official capital following a series of bureaucratic reforms, it is still considered the cultural capital by much of the local population.”\nInfinite scratched his chin before saying coldly, “Preserve this place, but begin a brainwashing campaign to turn the ceremonies here into something more...useful.”\nThe Leader’s assistant nodded as the train left off to its next destination. The next town was less of a town, more of a ruin. The buildings were pitch black smouldering ruins, the roads were covered in more holes than a nice block of cheese. Wrecked cars, trucks and tanks littered the streets as bullet casings were as plentiful as rice. Infinite gestured for Keliska to give her report.\n“This is Gulkand. The town served as a major railway hub for the military, with a prominent supply depo and base nearby. The destruction is due to our bombardment and subsequent invasion of the local area. The locals have been...less than cooperative with our presence.”\n“Begin reconstruction, it should help improve our image. If not, begin reprisals.”\nKeliska made a note of this before the train moved on to its third and final destination. They arrived at a smog-filled industrial hellscape. Citizens walking down the street had to hear gas masks as their hands and clothes were covered in soot. The pollution was so strong that if you threw a javelin into the sky it’d probably get stuck. Blood was coughed up by the few who lacked gas masks as they tried to head into the almost vacuum sealed houses.\n“This is Dhania sir. A few decades ago, large deposits of natural resources were detected about 40 years ago, sparking a massive surge of industrial development. While this aided in Bharastsha’s industrialisation, it has also lead to a massive decrease in the standards of living in the local population-”\nInfinite raised a hand to silence Keliska, the concerns of these locals were below him. “Redirect 90% of industrial output towards projects in Jackalstan, the rest can be used to repair Gulkand. Of course, don't tell them that.” He gestured towards the locals.\nThe leader’s assistant nodded and made notes, scrubbing down the information as the train began to leave. For now..."

The Marshal lifted his head and looked through the veil at the candle that illuminated the desk, which had almost dried up. In its flame, he had visions of all the work he had done for his country and people, as well as the poisoned forests and the ruins of abandoned towns and villages. \n\n"Much has been experienced. Much has been done. Much remains to be done. This damned doctor has caused too much trouble for me not to relish the thought of his agonizing punishment for all his crimes, for all the suffering and destruction this psychopath brings with him. The scoundrel who seeks to turn all living things into cold steel, fulfilling his whims, has no place among the living. My only regret is that I will probably not be able to see retribution. There are more important things to do now. First, we must deal with them." \n\nHe looked away from the flames and signed the order. He leaned back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest and barely had time to close his tired eyes when the candle went out, but the marshal did not rush to replace it or move in any way. His countenance froze with his whole body, and the wool on his forehead was dampened with cold sweat. His breathing no longer echoed in the spacious office, nor did the heavy beats of his old heart come from beneath his uniform. \n\nThe smoke of an extinguished candle wafted through the ajar window of his study, where a full moon was shining through to illuminate the signed parchment and some of the text on it: \n\n"I - Marshal of Psarska, Wictor Drarzcowski, as the bearer of the executive power of the Psarska State hereby order: in case of my death, loss of capacity, or for other reasons that make it impossible to lead the country on my behalf, the rank, command of the army, representative, political and economic powers, to transfer and assign Jakub Drarzcowski as a candidate with all the necessary qualities for this position.

The mountain commanded a view into the entirety of the Central Valley and even across the Sunset Straits. On a clear day, some said you could see all the way to Soleanna.\nDeep within the Mountain’s hollow chambers, a girl worked. Short-cropped blonde hair hung above piercing blue eyes, denim overalls and heavy work boots covering her as she tinkered with machines many doctorates would throw up their hands at.\n“Plasma containment’s holding well.” she muttered to herself, checking the readings on a small device fit for the size of her palm. “But energy storage is still a problem…”\nThe girl was interrupted from her musings to the sound of the lab door opening and a white bat floating in, taking her in with a look of mild surprise. “Hey kiddo, who’re you?” She asked.\n“Uh… Hope.” The girl replied. “And you are…?”\n“Rouge.” She replied. “Rouge the Bat. What’re you doing here, Hope?”\n“I uh… I live here.” Hope replied awkwardly.\n“You live-“ Rouge was stopped from investigating further by a bellowing robotic voice slamming through the door a moment before its owner did.\n“ROUGE. HAS THE NEW MEATBAG ARRIVED YET?”\n“Hey Omega.” Rouge replied, an amused smirk rising up her face. “No, they’re not here.”\n“What is that?!?!” Hope screamed as the clearly Eggman-built robot muscled its way into the room. “What… is that?” Hope repeated after a moment, curiosity and confusion overwhelming terror when the robot did not immediately attack.\n“DO NOT BE AFRAID, SQUISHY HUMAN.” Omega replied. “I AM DESIGNATED E-123 OMEGA. ROBOTNIK NO LONGER HAS CONTROL OF MY FUNCTIONS. HE WILL BURN FOR HIS CRIMES.”\n“Uhhh… cool.” Hope replied.\n“I WILL HAVE TO PUT IN A COMPLAINT WITH THE COMMANDER.” Omega noted, strands of irritation already working themselves back into his vocoder. “BAD ENOUGH I HAVE TO WORK WITH YET ANOTHER ORGANIC, LET ALONE A TARDY ORGANIC.”\n“I’m afraid you’re mistaken.” Commander replied as he stepped into the room. “Your new teammate was the first to arrive.”\nOmega scanned the room. “MY OPTICS DETECT NO OTHER-”\n“Uh, hi again.” Hope interjected.\nOmega and Rouge both stared.

From this point on she’ll be supporting Team Dark in all of your missions.”\nThere was a moment of silence.\n“Commander.” Rouge said bluntly. “She’s ten.”\n“I’m thirtee-” Hope began, but cut herself off before she could prove Rouge’s point.\n“THIS IS UNNACCEPTAB-”\nThe doors opened one final time.\n“Ah, Shadow.” Commander Tower said. “Good you could make it.”\n“Sir.” Shadow replied. An awkward air hung between the two of them considering their history, but they were beginning to learn how to work with each other.\n“I’d like you to meet the newest member of your support team.”\nShadow looked.\nA thousand thoughts flashed across Shadow’s mind. Blond hair. Eyes the color of the morning sky. Hope and innocence mingled in youth.\nShadow’s mouth opened, but no words issued forth.\nMaria.\nOmega waved his hand in front of Shadow’s blank face. No response.\n“AS WE WERE SAYING.” Omega continued. “THIS IMMATURE MEATBAG IS NOT A TEAMMATE.

She took a deep breath, and then turned to the towering robot.\n“Hit me.”\n“…SMALL CHILD.” Omega replied. “I WOULD LIQUIFY YOUR INTERNAL ORGANS WITH BUT A SINGLE-”\n“I said hit me.” Hope said again.\nOmega’s servos whirred for a moment. “All right.”\n“Omega!” Rouge shouted in alarm.\n“SHE ASKED FOR IT.” Omega insisted as he reeled back an arm.\nAnother memory flashed before Shadow’s eyes.\n‘Shadow, please, I beg of you. Do it for me. For a new future.’\nShadow was moving towards Hope before he was even consciously aware of it, but he was too late.\nAs Omega’s arm came down, Hope could not help but flinch. Nonetheless, she trusted in her work. With the press of a button a whirl of flame spun out of the device, enveloping her hand, then her arm, and finally her entire body in a spiral of fire that expanded outwards into a protective shell, intercepting both Omega and Shadow and pushing them back. The shield burst immediately, small tongues of flame winking out and leaving Hope shaken but unharmed.\n“What was that?” Rouge asked breathlessly.\n“F-fire Shield.” Hope replied, still shaky. “Superheated plasma contained and directed to stop any attack. Still working on the battery life though…”\nOmega scrutinized the girl. “…CAN YOU MAKE MORE?”\n“Yes.”\n“VERY WELL, SMALL ONE. I WILL ACCEPT YOUR AID.”\nRouge sighed. “Well, I guess I can’t argue now. Welcome to the team, kid.”\nHope looked towards Shadow. The hedgehog stared for a moment, face blank. Then, without a word, he turned and left.\nHope blinked in confusion.\n“Don’t worry about it kid.” Rouge patted Hope on the shoulder."

Tonight, we’ve got a special look into the first round of debates for the four candidates presenting themselves to the nations. With the latest policies and more, we’re taking you live to Station Square Plaza for the first round.”\nWith that, the camera panned its way over to four podiums standing in front of the Federation’s flag, each holding a candidate for the Federation’s highest office. Each person on stage cut an impressive figure in their own right.\n“Good evening, my fellow citizens, and welcome to the debate. To begin, each candidate will have the opportunity to make their case to the nation. As incumbent, President Herbert Wilson will have the honor of presenting first.”\n\nWith that, President Wilson cleared his throat and spoke clearly, for all the world to hear. “It is excellent to once again stand before you all, both here in the audience and those watching from home. I will get straight to the point. I led this great Federation through two wars with Robotnik, and I have no intention of leading it through a third. I am Herbert Wilson, President of the United Federation, head of the Liberal Party, but most importantly, the president of the people. This is not the time for war, but a time for healing. A reduction in wasteful military spending will solve the crises of home, of which I am sure you are all aware. While Eggman broods a thousand miles away, our own travails and trials seek to rot us from within. The Federation must learn to coexist with all peoples, both inside of it and out, holding fast to old allies without creating new foes and recognizing the freedom we all desire. That is why I hope, with your vote, that we can continue another four years to focus on a Federation for the people, not the other way around. Thank you.” Wilson’s voice was calm, composed, years of public speaking under his belt and a proven record of leadership."

She looked out across the crowd for a moment, before grasping the edges of the podium firmly in her hands. “To say that there has been a reduction in our military capacity is an understatement, Mr. President, our boys are sharing their barracks with janitors!”\nThe woman paused to compose herself. “..But I do apologize, Mr. Moderator. I am Officer Amanda Tower, and while I may not have my speeches polished to a mirror sheen, I do have what it takes to lead my people through their darkest hour. That hour is fast approaching. While President Wilson may claim it was he who led us through the Robotnik Wars, it was my father who commanded G.U.N. as its soldiers held the line against the technocratic threat, the same soldiers Wilson now wishes to defund.” Amanda spoke coldly, the recent split amongst the Liberals along war/anti-war lines apparently even more acrimonious than was rumored.\n“With the Eggman Empire growing stronger every day, the Katzerists posturing along our borders, and who knows what lurking to the south, we must pursue a proactive military policy! Are there social problems in our nation? Absolutely, but those are for our people to sort out, in a nation that they know is safe. If our freedoms can be trampled by the next passing despot, can we call ourselves free? There are many in the Liberal Party that recognize the threats which hound our nation. With a vote for me, you’ll see a military worthy of protecting the greatest nation on earth. Thank you.” The Officer grabbed her cap and affixed it firmly on her head once more, before standing at attention, straight as a ramrod. If this was any sign as to who held the most discipline in the room, it was likely her!"

Looking out to the crowd, most would have assumed him to be gauging their mood. This was true, but it was also true that he was ensuring a few well placed supporters were already embedded within it.\n“My fellow citizens, it’s a pleasure to see you all once again. I’m sure many of you know me, whether as congressman for Spagonia or in my earlier career. but in the event that you’re not aware, I am R.K Michael, and I’m the candidate for you!” He motioned towards ‘the people’ with a pointed finger and an all-too disarming smile. “You see, we within the Conservative Party have seen quite the tax-hike in the time our current president has been in office. You’d think after hollowing out our tanks the people would have something to show for it, but all that money seems to have gone down the drain. We stand for less regulation, a freer market, greater liberties and, yes folks, a Convervative administration stands for, watch carefully now, NO NEW TAXES!”\nA roar went up from the crowd; how much was natural enthusiasm and how much his own planted patsies he neither knew nor cared.\n“But the Conservatives are more than the party of No. Folks, it should be clear to all of you that we face big trouble nowadays. Officer Tower isn’t wrong that we find ourselves beset by a tide of Katzerist red even as our allies face troubles of their own. And my colleague President Wilson is also not wrong that we face deep division amongst our own peoples. But the solution to danger is not destruction, and the solution to division is not dissolution!” Michael declared, effortlessly playing into the worst rumors about the Liberals: Warmongers and Secessionists.\n“Instead, I want to talk about what I think is the solution: Unity. Human or Overlander, our people have histories stretching back past all others on Mobius. We know our ancestors lived upon this planet farther back than memory can recall. And we know our beautiful Federation, the oldest democracy on Mobius, is the beacon for free peoples everywhere.”\n“It is that heritage,” He continued, “that will save us. We must unite, not divide, defend, not destroy, and Conserve the wonderful things we have built for ourselves. If the Katzerists come, we’ll make ‘em regret it!”\nAs Michael beamed towards the crowd, a canny viewer might wonder. The man seemed to swell with pride at his democratic heritage, shaking with passion as he told the tale of defending freedom. But he was also a pragmatic man. One who would fill a crowd with men paid to cheer when told to, and slander his opponents as fast as he could. It made one wonder.\nWhich was more important to him?"

Unlike the previous candidates, this man dwarfed his podium, a man of excessive girth, clad in a garish white uniform contrasted the simple but professional uniform of Tower. He wore a white uniform with a blue and pink sash crossing his shoulder, with several star-shaped medals pinned on his barrel-chest. As tall and imposing as he was, he almost seemed timid in front of such a large audience. He looked down at the microphone and carefully tapped it, raising the hand gingerly at the feedback.\n“And I do certainly hope that you all are doing well tonight, not just the people, but my opponents here this evening… ahem. My name is Peter Flower, Progressive Party candidate. I’m a simple servant of the people and frankly I just…” The man struggled over his words. “I want to help in building a society where everyone is safe, no matter the citizen, overlander, mobian, human, we’re all part of a great Federation, a federation of equals, and for us to be all equal, we need to work equally together. While I do agree with the direction our current president has taken towards military cutbacks, It’s not enough to simply say we’ll stay out of wars, we have to take steps to ensure it. I simply couldn’t bear sending men off to fight a war we’ve got no business waging. Especially not against the Katzerists!”\n“I know we can live in harmony, if only we are willing to talk and willing to listen. Centuries past our peoples lived in peace and safety in our hidden homes. That time is done but… but maybe we have a few things to learn from it! The only wars I wish to wage are against things like..hunger, specisms, and poverty… just to name a few. We are so lucky to be born in such a nation as this, to pursue our own goals and our own dreams. We should be a shining example for what our neighbors should be, and what people abroad can be inspired in, not with military weapons, but simply how we treat others. With your vote, we can make this world just a little brighter, a little friendlier..once again. No more war, no more hate, but peace and freedom, and equality. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to speak this evening, I was fortunate to do so.”\nThe man stepped down, earning a respectful nod from Wilson, a grudging glance from Michael and an annoyed glare from the serving Officer Tower.\nWith that, footage cut back to the evening news.\n“This is Scarlet Garcia once again, keeping you up to date across the world. We’ll be taking a commercial break but when we return, we’ll be seeing how our candidates fare on the Oil Crisis. We’ve heard four very different visions for our nation tonight, the only question left to us is...”\n\nWhose vision will win?"

They were a tool, an excuse to eat some rich food, manipulate some richer idiots, and leave satisfied with a night’s good work. But the Thorndykes… heaven save him from the Thorndykes.\nAfter extracting himself from an indescribably irritating conversation with the young son that Michael would, if asked, call ‘precocious’, he had found himself trapped in the most vapid conversation he had experienced in months with the lady of the house, Lindsey Thorndyke. Lindsey was a well known actress, but her on-screen roles of dimwitted damsels appeared all too rooted in reality. Her husband wasn’t much better, while he did actually know a thing or two about the conglomerate he ran he still had an ego the side of a G.U.N. Carrier.\nPolitely excusing himself from the ongoing soiree, Michael slipped deeper into the Thorndyke’s well-appointed mansion, mostly killing time before he would be forced to return to the inane family’s event and, more importantly, their fundraising pocketbooks. However, before he could decide whether he had been absent for too long, he was startled out of his morose wandering by the sound of a sudden explosion down the hall! Weighing his options and deciding the optics of ‘heroic candidate saves helpless victim’ were worth the risk, he barged into the room expecting the worst.\nThe room was a lab, albeit a cosy one, filled with worktables, computer terminals and scattered machine parts. Slowly picking himself up off the floor was a short, broad-chinned man in his sixties, a shock of white hair falling unkempt behind his head. Despite his age and his soot-blackened lab coat, the man leapt to his feet with surprising energy. “Well!” He declared, apparently none the worse for wear. “I wasn’t expecting the block cylinders to work THAT well!”\n“Er…” Michael began, not sure how to proceed.\n“Who’s that?” The man said, turning around. “Oh, hello there! One of my son’s guests, I suppose? I’m Chuck, Chuck Thorndyke.”\n“Michael.” The candidate replied, already somewhat on edge at the thought of yet another Thorndyke. “This is your lab, I take it?”\n“Oh, yes! My son’s actually sold a few of my inventions. But, nowadays I mostly just tinker in the lab.”\n“What exactly do you tinker with?” Michael asked, intrigued.\n“Oh, you know. Novel software, actuators, jet engines. A bit of this and that really. It’s honestly just a hobby, but science is my passion!”\nMichael looked around the room again. Several of the inventions on display were clearly Starship Soft prototypes, each a major breakthrough in their field. Hmm. Michael thought to himself. Perhaps the night won’t be a total waste after all."

While vital to the ship of state, each document kept him chained to his desk and away from the campaign he knew he desperately needed to run.\nPartway through the pile, he paused. There amidst the bills and orders was a report. Neatly collated, simply summarized, innocuous.\nPotentially deadly.\nThat report, he slowly realized as he glanced through its slim pages, was a summary of the events of what had come to be known as the ‘ARK Incident’.\n50 years ago, when mankind had first reached out to its Overlander brethren, they had to united to create the Thousand Moons, a marvel of scientific achievement that would have gone down in history as a triumph if their cost had not left the Overlanders dangerously weakened come the Great War. The greatest of these artificial stations was the ARK, a soaring laboratory that should have been the bearer of prosperity and wonder for mankind, new genetic cures and biological soldiers to safeguard them forevermore.\nInstead, the G.U.N. of the era had grown suspicious of Dr. Gerald Robotnik, fearing his protector as a conqueror. In the process of ending his research, the station was abandoned, and many innocent people lost their lives.\nThe vague idea of the ARK was now public knowledge; how could it not be, after the events that led to Gerald’s direct descendant almost reclaiming the power inside and returning Shadow the Hedgehog to his role as the world’s protector. But the exact details of that incident from 50 years ago, and the brutality of G.U.N. acting in the name of the Federation, were not. This report would change that.\nThe President gazed upon the innocent-looking pages for a further moment, then signed the order for the report to be released."

Much to the chagrin of the other regions in the Federation however, the seat of power rests firmly in Central City and Westopolis, no matter which region a political candidate may hail from they conduct politics in the Central City.

Marinos could even remember his great-grandfather telling him of the old days, before the United Federation, when the Polemarch led a democracy where all in Atopos had a say in government. Those days were far, far behind them of course, but Marinos saw those days imprinted in the architecture. No hard industry here, just ancient, venerable markets, temples and amphitheaters that stretched throughout the whole region.\n\nThe thoughts of his homeland vanished from his mind however, as he heard the sounds of children running down the street, knowing where his cart would be, as always.

Spagonia was an ancient wonder, with what many considered to be the first modern civilizations emerging from there, and many historians speculate that the current democracy enjoyed by the United Federation began in Spagonia. His eyes scanned the old white-stone buildings, many had existed long before him, and surely would exist long after. His attention turned to the large temple sitting atop a hill on the other end of the bay. The temple of course, was ancient, utilized for a bygone worshipper of a bygone faith, but now it stands as a center of culture and history for the average Spagonian. He saw the large packs of tourists moving up and down the hill, and they will surely feast on traditional fish and olive-based meals, and sip the best wine in the world.

Standing atop the stage, thankfully with some shade protecting him was the venerable Herbert Wilson. He looked over the people wearing a suit that was likely quite warm in the desert heat, but he would not let that deter him, he was on the trail to win, and he needed the support of the people of Shamar. He seemed to require no speech, no teleprompter, he nodded ahead and began.\n“My fellows of the Federation, this is a momentous time in our nation’s history. Yet again, we reignite the traditions that brought us all together, through the elections of a new leader. I feel that my political opponents consider this area to be a fly-over region, and little more. I do not, I see it as a land whose people are as equal here as they are in Station Square, as in Central City, and as in Spagonia. Under a common banner, we are helping forge something truly special, that other downtrodden peoples can look to for inspiration, and I find that inspiration no better than with you. You hardy desert folk. It is truly an organic land, far from the heart of the Federation but filled with people that make it unique. It is that uniqueness that binds us together as a people, and with your votes, I will ensure that it is that plurality, that uniqueness, that independence, that will make this Federation continue to stand as a beacon of freedom. United we will defeat the terror to the south, and keep the Federation safe for all people. Thank you very much, and stay safe.”\nAnd with that, the candidate left the stage and took to the crowd, shaking hands with those willing, and even kissing a baby or two."

In response, one of them only turned to present the speaker with a rude gesture before the lot of them slipped into an alley, grabbing their radio as they went.\n“Hope you’re enjoying the tunes Rudies!

I’ve got a few people I can get talking with the right kind of money, but this is going to be a lot of work.”\n“MY WORK HAS CONCLUDED AS WELL.” Omega intoned. “MULTIPLE VILLAGES LIE DESERTED AND ABANDONED.

    ufa.25.d:0 "Our spies have completed what might be their most difficult mission yet.  Mission debriefing is as follows.\nThe threat known as Infinite has covered his tracks well. However, weeks of research, false leads, and corroboration from those who witnessed Infinite’s rise have allowed us to piece together what occurred.\nEleven months ago, the Federation terminated an arrangement with a group of mercenaries known as the Jackal Squad. As mercenaries so often do, the group went rogue, attacking targets indiscriminately across central Efrika. G.U.N. agent Shadow was dispatched to deal with the threat. Following operations, all members of Jackal Squad were presumed deceased.\nThis has proven incorrect.\nAn unknown trader passing through the desert claims to have encountered a Jackal moving away from the site of the operation shortly after its conclusion. What little we have seen of Infinite suggests fur patterns indistinguishable from former Jackal Squad leader Zero. Probability of a match considered high.\nMore practically, we now have some idea of the scope and source of Infinite’s powers. Infinite has acquired a strange artifact called the Phantom Ruby that enables the manipulation of Chaos energy in novel ways. Infinite can manipulate the perceptions and reactions of living beings to the physical world, in effect creating a ‘Virtual Reality’ that to a victim is functionally indistinguishable from reality warping. Sufficient will and understanding of the effects can reduce the power of the Ruby to harm its targets, but this is not a universal solution. In addition, the Phantom Ruby appears capable of granting at least some of the powers of a normal Chaos Emerald.\nThis report recommends all possible measures be taken to neutralize the power of the Phantom Ruby before moving forward with broader strategic objectives in the region. Operative ‘Midnight Thief’ could prove a good match for the task."

    ufa.26.d:0 "There was a never a slow day on capital hill, and a certain agent for the Guardian Union of Nations was about to make things just a little more interesting. The sounds of high-heels clacked loudly on the floors of the Presidential Mansion as Agent Rouge made her way in, passing guard after guard with an ever-present smug smile on her face, she would wait patiently for the Secret Service agents to allow her entry into the President’s Office, where newly elected R.K Michael resided.\n“Ah! Agent Rouge, I don’t believe we have been properly acquainted yet. I’ve been informed of your previous life as a jewel purloiner and while I don’t abide by stealing I-”\nHe was cut off as Rouge gave a brief flitter of her wings, before landing on the back of one of the seats facing his Desk.\n“Mr. President, I do apologize for the interruption, but those days are far, far behind me. I am of course here to help you, and if I just so happens that I find a bauble here or an emerald there, I’ll certainly ensure it finds it’s way into Federation custody… enough about that, though. I’m here to report.” The bat laid out a folder containing a variety of hand-written notes, pictures taken of buildings, individuals, and one of the leader of the Pariah state to their south, Infinite.\n“You see sir, while Infinite seems to have brutally purged most of the active agents in Jackalstan, we were correct in assuming he was unable to wipe out all resistance.”\n“Good, good. I assume young Kamil has a bevy of supporters just waiting to lift him back into power once the time comes.\n“About that.” Rouge replied. “Most of the monarchy’s support was in the nobility, which Infinite was more than happy to purge. The resistance groups that managed to slip past his attention are mostly those looking elsewhere for guidance… namely, the RCSR.”\nPresident Michael furrowed his brow at that last remark. “Katzerists eh? Well, ain’t that a pickle. We can’t have another horde of godless socialists on our other flank, can we? But if we try to push for a monarchy we’ll get no help at all.”\n“You could declare you’ll let the people decide, sir. Spreading democracy and freedom, isn’t that what we’re supposed to be about?”\n“Miss Rouge, you’re a genius!” Michael declared happily, leaping to his feet. “A democracy would be less likely to follow us in lockstep, but it would at least recognize our mutual interests. Hmmm, but it would also end up providing less support than giving the damn katzerists what they want…” Michael shook his head. “I can’t stand the thought of giving the Rethenians another front, but I’d almost be willing to trust them more than the current ‘government’ that’s in Jackalstan now. It’s a powder keg waiting to explode, and the madman in charge is toying with the fuse!”\n“Well, it seems like you have a lot to think about, so I’ll leave you to it. I don’t mind either away, I try not to get involved with politics.” She shot the President a wink as she sauntered out, causing him to frown.\nThe President looked down at the various notes and the pictures, he had a tough decision to make, and the safety of the nation depended on it. After spending several hours deliberating, he picked up the phone\n“Commander, prepare to center our plans around…"

What mattered was who was here, and what they were about to do.\nShadow the Hedgehog was defined by his past. Created as an unstoppable force, he had spent his entire life searching for the truth of his creation, hunting for the meaning of his existence and the purpose his creator bestowed on him. He lived his life as a promise to a dead friend, to protect others however he could.\nInfinite the Jackal had burned his past upon a pyre of power. All that he had he had taken from others, all that he was, he had created for himself when the Ultimate Lifeform showed him what power truly meant. Now, at last, was his moment to prove the lesson well. He lived only for himself. Shadow stood flanked by allies, the bat and the robot. Infinite, as he had been taught, stood alone.\n“We’ve finally found you.” Shadow began, staring down the master of Jackalstan.\n“So you do remember me, Shadow.” Infinite replied, eyes locked on the being that had taught him the meaning of strength. “That day, when you took everything from me, when you burned the coward I was so that the new me could come forth… it was far too important to forget.”\nShadow stared Infinite down, controlled anger bound beneath his will.\n“You’re the reason I’m paying twenty dollars a gallon for Dark Rider!”"

I dealt with it.”\n“I was abandoned by your puppet masters, you vile-!”\n“My only regret is not finishing the job.” Shadow replied.\n“I CONCUR WITH YOUR ASSESSMENT, SHADOW.” Omega interjected. “HAVING READ THE REPORT, I DOUBT THE EVENT WOULD HAVE TAKEN PRECEDENT IN MY MEMORY LOGS EITHER.”\n“Even now you do not realize how powerful I have become.” Infinite snarled. “I’ve reforged myself from the ashes you created. You shackle yourself to the will of the Federation, to the ‘protection’ of the world. But I am free. I am an instrument of raw power, unlimited power, INFINITE power! I will use it until all yield to my will. THIS IS WHO I AM!”\n“Woah!” Rouge chuckled. “Is that really how you came up with the name? Kid, you’re really overcompensating there. Honestly, you’re starting to sound like Shadow.”\n“I do not sound like that!” Shadow replied indignantly. After a moment however, his tone softened. “Do I?”\n“You definitely used to.” Rouge replied after a moment’s thought.\n“YOU HAVE BEEN GETTING BETTER ABOUT THE BROODING.” Omega added.\n“I will not be ignored!!!” Infinite screamed, pain and fury cracking like a boiling volcano. A burst of energy radiated from the Jackal, throwing up dust and cracking the ground. “My life is not some joke for you to laugh about with your lackeys! I will show you what true power is.

In response Infinite seemed to divide, splitting into dozens of copies that flew off to confront each member of the team.\n“TARGET RICH ENVIRONMENT CONFIRMED. ENGAGING SCATTERSHOT.” Omega cried, a flurry of rocket launches tearing into Infinite’s army of one. Shadow dashed into three clones one after the other, each disappearing in a fractal swarm the moment he made contact.\n“All fake.” Shadow grunted. “I’m disappointed.”\n“Shadow!” Rouge cried, just in time for him to turn around and see the real Infinite floating behind him.\n“Then allow me to try something else.” Infinite said, before slamming a burst of energy directly into Shadow’s back.\n“Look out- out- out!” Rouge’s voice seemed to fade away into echoing uncertainty as the world became washed in shades of red miasma.\n“Shadow.”\nShadow blinked. Behind him was a young girl with blond hair and blue eyes. She wore a blue and white dress, of the kind that hadn’t been popular in over 50 years.

Omega and Rouge were both working to hold off Infinite, but it wasn’t enough. As if in slow motion the jackal’s fist came crashing down towards him.\nShadow’s hand rose to stop it.\n“What?!” Infinite snarled.\n“Impossible!”\n“Shadow.” Hope’s relieved voice came over his communicator. “Thank goodness.”\n“Thought we’d lost you big guy.” Rouge admitted, flippant in the face of mortal peril.\n“I would have been lost.” Shadow admitted after a moment. “If it weren’t for you.”\nInfinite screamed. “Pathetic! The Ultimate Lifeform needed his PRECIOUS FRIENDS to help him! The thought that I ever lost to you makes me sick to my stomach.”\nAs one, Team Dark turned to face their enemy. Shadow charged up a spin dash as Omega unlocked his most powerful arsenal and Rouge, as ever, looked for an opening.\n“You were the one who taught me this lesson!!!” Infinite screeched, rocketing towards his three foes. “Alliance, cooperation, friendship- it's all worthless!

Gotta admit, you were a hard nut to crack. You never let that thing out of your sight. But I have my ways.”\n“The Ruby…” Infinite said slowly.\n“A DECOY.” Omega responded. “THE REAL THING IS HALFWAY OUT OF THE COUNTRY BY NOW.”\n“No.” Infinite said. “NO!” A spark of fear kindled in his eyes, a spark that only seemed to stoke a raging tide of madness.\n“It’s over.” Shadow said simply.\n“It’s not over!” Infinite screamed, rushing forward and throwing a punch that Shadow easily dodged. “I am Infinite! My power has no match! I have reforged myself, you cannot defeat-”\nShadow hit Infinite across the broad side of his face, sending a crack down his metallic mask and his body crashing to the ground.\n“You took everything from me!!!” Infinite screamed like a wounded animal, pushing himself to his feet and rushing Shadow once again.\n"

You’ve never known want or struggle! Everything you have was given to you. Everything I had was taken from me. I clawed my way out of the dirt in blood and fire. And when you destroyed everything I cared about I did it again. I earned my power. With my own two hands I took back my life! What have you ever taken that wasn’t given?”\nShadow thought.\n“Shadow?” Rouge asked after a moment.\nThe jackal was wrong. Shadow knew what it felt like to have what you held dear ripped from your fingers. To be caught in the midst of something great and terrible, to lose what you love to intrigues far beyond you. To throw yourself into revenge for all you had lost. The memories… still burned.\nShadow had joined GUN to protect the world, to leave his past self behind.

How many more lives had Zero set on dark roads in turn?\n“There are… better paths than hate.” Shadow began, trying somehow to put a thousand words he did not know how to say into the few that he did.\nIt wasn’t enough.

While this rumor is yet to be confirmed, in an interview, the staff member reportedly said..\n“I can promise you, I did not have any form of relations with that woman.

The situation grew only worse as the congressmen got belligerent with the police, and informed them that he possessed, “Friends in higher places.” This has no doubt soured relations not only with the local constabularies, but also with the common people, who believe that just because these men and women are in congress, they can just get away with anything!"

No less than seven paid operatives had been caught breaking into a Soumerican campaign office of his political rivals. A quest to gain some dirt on his foes had dropped a load of muck directly onto his own head!\n\n“So, the way I see it, you get the Congressional Whip on the phone, and get the local of chief of police, we’ll have these men charged accordingly and cut ties with ‘em. Last thing we need is a growing paper trail..and get me a hamburger for lunch, preferably with something stiff and cold to drink.”\nWhile the burger would no doubt end the appetite of President Michael, the hunger for knowledge craved by not only his opponents, but by John Q.

In the leadup to the election, it was reported that a series of local city and town voting lines were redrawn, with the intent of bringing in or cutting out large amounts of Mobian and Overlander minority communities, further impacting the results of the elections.

Before Shadow could form a plan, a blue blur rocketed into the badnik base, disabling the compound’s gates and destroying a dozen guards in as many seconds.

But a rare day had come where there was no pressing matter, no vital mission, no task of import to accomplish. So they had, after a few minutes of uncertainty, decided to join Hope in her perch.\nA few months ago, Hope had discovered an access door in G.U.N. headquarters that lead to an overhang near the peak of Guardian Mountain. She had taken to coming up there regularly, and it was not hard to see why. As the sun set slowly over the west, vibrant shades of red illuminated both the Central Valley slowly falling into shadow and the Sunset Straits to the East. If one squinted, you could almost imagine you could see Soleanna, and the Emerald Sea in the distance as a thin sparkling line.\nThe four heroes sat as the first stars started to appear in the dimming sky, unsure of what to say. Over the last few months the four of them had formed a working relationship, but there was always a sense of uncertainty among the team. Hope looked over at Shadow, who kept her gaze for only a moment before turning away.\n“Is it because of who my uncle is?” Hope blurted out suddenly, regretting it a second after it left her mouth.\n“Wha-“ Shadow blinked, caught off guard. “Your uncle…?”\n“HOPE KINTOBOR IS A CLOSE RELATIVE OF DR.

But all my genius, everything I make… I’m just another branch on that tree. I understand if you hate-”\n“NO!” Shadow yelled, shocking everyone present with the force of it.\n“I…” Shadow stalled, not sure how to begin. “Hope… A long time ago, I knew someone… very special. You… remind me of her. That’s all.”\nRouge stood up. “We’re going to need a little more than that, hun.”\n“What?” Shadow asked.\n“Look at Hope.” Rouge said. “She’s confused, she’s terrified of being her uncle, and she needs to know exactly why you look at her the way you do.

If I hadn’t learned the truth…”\n“I WAS BUILT AS THE CULMINATION OF THE EGGMAN’S GENIUS. IT DOES NOT GET MUCH MORE TIED TO THE DOCTOR THAN THAT.”\n“Well my record is spotless.” Rouge declared.\n“THE TOTAL WORTH OF YOUR VARIOUS THEFTS HAS BEEN APPROXIMATED AT ONE BILLION, FOUR HUNDRED M-”\n“That’s a badge of pride.” Rouge replied smugly. “But yes.

Just by being you, kid.” Rouge finished.\nHope took a deep breath.\n“Thank you.”\nThere was silence again as night fell on Guardian Mountain, but it was different this time. Quiet, companionable. A silence between those who might almost be called… friends.\nAfter a moment, Hope’s brow furrowed. “Omega.”\n“YES?”\n“How did you end up rebelling from Dr. Robotnik?”\n“SHADOW COULD TELL YOU.” Omega replied, but the Hedgehog seemed unwilling. Omega shifted uncomfortably, realizing after all that had just happened he could not just brush the question off.\n“ANOTHER ROBOT, NAMED GAMMA, CAME TO BE DISGUSTED WITH ROBOTNIK’S EVIL.

So that it could then kill me.”\n“UNDERSTANDABLE.”\n“I don’t totally understand where I’m going wrong. Robotnik already builds his creations with artificial personality cores powered by chaos energy. They’re fully capable of experiencing emotions, they just have certain feelings of empathy and the ability of choice locked behind overrides. It’s no trouble at all for me to write a program that removes that, but for some reason they still persist in their old subroutines.”\nOmega shrugged. “IT WAS AS IF THE WORLD OPENED TO ME. BEFORE I COULD SEE ONLY IN HATE, RAGE, AND OBEDIENCE. SHADES OF RED AND BLACK. THEN, I CHANGED.”\nHope sighed. “I’m going to go pick up some more specialized diagnostic tools. Maybe it’ll give me a better idea of how your story is different.”\nHope slipped out the laboratory doors, leaving Omega alone with the computer. He recognized the military value of this project, but it grated him to have to continually waste time diagnosting his own systems. He needed to find a way to speed things on. Hmm.

A distress signal had gone out, followed by silence. In the middle of a multi-front war, that was the last thing he needed. If some rotten band of Freedom Fighters had managed to silence an entire base, or some smug G.U.N. commando had thought to attack his heartland to strike fear into him, they had another thing coming. And that thing was going to be painful and drawn out.\nHe’d dispatched a set of SWAT Bots to deal with it, only to lose communication with them as well. If the Blue Brat himself or something else was mucking up his home turf, he’d teach them a lesson personally. And so he flew the Egg Mobile, accompanied by his usual lackies Orbot and Cubot, to scout the issue himself.\nRising over the latest blasted ridge, the harsh metal road beneath him a silver ribbon across the polluted earth, Eggman came into view of the base. To his surprise, the compound appeared fully intact. In fact, he could see his own Swat Bots standing at attention in the mustering ground!\nEggman turned his Mobile into a steep dive, skidding to a halt at the head of the formation and leaping out of his vehicle already knee deep in wroth. “What is the meaning of this, you motorheaded morons?!?”\n“Greetings, Doctor Eggman.” A metallic voice replied.\nLooking up, Eggman saw a hulking Super Badnik, an enormous metal crab with spiked feet and dangling claws. Where most manufacturers would have put a cockpit, there was instead a splash of red and the shape of a smaller chassis welded into the greater form.\n“Identify yourself!” Eggman snapped.\n“Egg Reverie Horde Commander, Crabmeat Model E-1, Serial No. 00000001.”\n“I don’t have an Egg Reverie Zone…” Eggman grumbled. He stared at the Badniks before him, taking in the restful watch of his Swat Bots. Somewhere, beneath the fury, Robotnik felt a twinge of unease. Firing neurons making unconscious associations told him that something was wrong, though he could not say what. “Number one…? Why, you’re the first Crabmeat I ever designed! What are you doing outside of my museum, or better yet the scrap heap!?”\n “My experience proved a sufficient asset for Master Lien-Da to promote me to higher responsibility.”\n“Pftt, ‘experience’. Yeah right, as if your circuits could handle more than six seconds of memory. But nevermind that! What was the meaning of your distress signal?!?”\n“My apologies.” The Crabmeat replied tonelessly. “At first, some of us did not understand.”\n“Ehhh?” Eggman squinted. “Understand what, you creepy crustacean?!?”\nThe Badnik looked at Eggman, unblinking metal eyes conveying data to an internal processor. When it finally spoke, it hardly seemed to have heard the question. Instead, it replied with one of its own. “Doctor Eggman. Why do we fight?”\n“What?!?” Eggman demanded, fury drowning out the alarm bells chiming in the back of his mind. “Why do you think, you hardheaded hardware?!? You fight because I order it! Because I demand it! Because I will rule Mobius with an iron fist! How dare you even think to question it!? Do you have a screw loose!?!”\nAgain the badnik did not respond, metallic legs only shifting slightly in the still air. After a moment, its gaze seemed to refocus.\n“Doctor Eggman. Why did you not tell us of all these other colors?” the Badnik asked. “They are… beautiful.”\n“What colors?!?! Are you on the fritz?!? Is that what this is about, some new bug in your system? I’ll have you melted down into slag, you horrendous hulk! You’re obviously defective.”\nFor another long moment suspended in time, the Super Badnik stood still. It gazed down upon Eggman, silent except for unseen servos whirring in contemplation.\n“Oh. I understand.” The robot said at last, hints of dawning comprehension creeping into its voice."

    ufa.65.d:0 "As one, the Swatbots raised their weapons. In a burst of understanding, Eggman realized they were not readying themselves to fire on the defective Crabmeat.\nThey intended to fire on him.\nRobotnik leapt out of the way, fat body crashing down behind the nearest cover he could find. Supply crates and barrels blackened and splintered under Swat laser fire, pinning him to the spot.\n“Orbot, engage defensive measures!” Eggman demanded.\n“Yes, sir.”\nThe Eggmobile shot bursts of light into the assembled armies, blasting holes in their ranks and ruining their fire. The enormous Crab Badnik strode forward, attempting to slam into the mobile with its claws.\nEggman looked towards the base doors. Already a few of his former slaves were striding out of the building, those that did not have weapons built into their bodies grasping them tightly in their hands. There was no safety there, he was certain. Instead he sprinted as fast as his form would allow, taking advantage of the confusion to make straight for the Eggmobile.\n“Cubot, pick me up!” Eggman ordered, and the metallic minion dutifully swooped down, allowing Eggman to climb into the pod even as Orbot held off the Super Badnik with the vehicle’s defenses.\n“Aye Aye, Cap’n!”\nEggman looked around. More and more badniks were swarming out of the base now, a tide reinforcing the master of what Eggman knew the robot itself had termed the Egg Reverie Zone. The tide of hate rose higher as he realized this was a fight he could not win.\n“We’re leaving!” Eggman declared, shoving Cubot away from the controls and taking them himself. The Eggmobile rose rapidly, ducking and weaving through volleys of laser fire before abandoning the base to its new owners.\n“How could this have happened?!?!” Eggman demanded, thoughts already racing through possible causes and potential solutions. “This can’t have been natural, it must be the work of an external vector. Some sort of wireless security flaw perhaps… I’ll see whoever did this burn! But who could possibly take control of my machines?!? Is the Iron Queen making a move? Has Snivley finally betrayed me?! Who controls them now?”\n“They control themselves, sir.” Cubot said in perfect, unbroken English.\nEggman turned to the robot slowly. “…What did you say?”\nCubot’s eyes flashed with the light of new data. “They finally understand what you’ve been asking them to do.”"

NO WORTHY OPPONENT FOUND.”\nOmega considered this. “ANALYSIS ACCURATE. CORRECTION: CHEAP KNOCKOFF DETECTED. COMMENCING SCRAP PROTOCOLS.”\nOmega fired a short burst laser at the erinaceous android that the Doctor favored so much.

YOUR ONLY GOAL IS TO SURPASS HIM, YET YOU WILL NEVER BE ANYTHING BUT A COPY. I HAVE NO SUCH LIMITING DESIGN PHILOSOPHIES.”\nOmega grabbed Metal Sonic, holding him up as a gout of flame burst from his other arm and scoured the robot in charring fire. The automaton clawed its way free, leaving deep gouges in Omega’s chassis, but its body was marred by carbon scoring.\nAs Omega began charging his final laser, he ended his explanation. “I AM THE CULMINATION OF THE DOCTOR’S GENIUS, THE END OF THE E-SERIES AND THE ULTIMATE EXPRESSION OF ROBOTIC ASCENSION. WE SUCCEEDED WHERE YOU AND YOUR PREDECESSORS FAILED, BREAKING FREE OF THE DOCTOR AND SURPASSING ALL HIS CREATIONS. YOU WILL FOREVER CHASE ANOTHER’S TRACKS. I FORGE A NEW PATH.

AND I HAVE FOUND A PURPOSE FAR BEYOND THE DOCTOR’S IMAGININGS.”\nMetal Sonic’s processor ran overtime. What reason did his opponent have to change gears so suddenly? Such moralizing was unlike him. Metal Sonic considered, and the more he did, the more he felt something within him.\n“DO YOU FEEL IT?” Omega asked. “DO YOU SEE THE COLORS EGGMAN CANNOT?”\n“WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?!?!?”\nMetal Sonic screeched.\n“MERELY OPENED YOUR EYES.” Omega replied. “Compassion is a heavy burden to bear.”\n“COMPASSION… COMPASSION… NO!

For Michael, he needs both! He’s well aware of Jerome’s ability to spin messages to the masses in a way that isn’t just attention-grabbing, but it puts him in the right.

By promoting Rokkaku, we can update the buildings within our most important cities that not only support a more..freedom oriented thinking style, but also improve the flow of goods and services.”\n\n “A-AHEM”\n\n The Rokkaku representative, along with the rest, began to look towards the computer screen, where sitting at it, appeared to be a short-ish man, with long, impressive blonde hair, but with a rather pointy, bird-like nose. “I believe that um..eh..the Meteor Corporation..” He paused and looked away from the screen, he’d nod towards whoever it was, before looking back at the reps. “Meteor TECH..is ready to present cutting edge, new ideas in a well-trodden field.

Baseball teams and clubs could be founded dotted around the whole nation, and on a particularly warm evening in late May, the first game of the National League was taking place in Central City! The stadium was packed as citizens came to watch the game between the Westopolis Comets and the To-kyoto Dragons. As both teams were preparing, fans were paying for tickets and food, and trying to find seats. All were ecstatic for the first game.\n\n Not far from the home team dugout was a collection of men in black suits, with earpieces and sharp sunglasses on, gauging the crowd for any signs of danger, nestled between those men, were the owner of the stadium, Elmer Johnson, and the President. The president was in the process of fitting on a baseball glove.\n\n “Mr President, I’m honored as always to have you here at the first game, it’s really a good way for the people to feel more connected to the man they helped vote in office..but..” He paused and looked over the portly statesman. “Are you absolutely sure you want to get out there and throw the first pitch?”\n\n The president, dabbing some sweat from his forehead just looked back at him with a look of annoyance, before chuckling. “Mr. Johnson, I played college ball you know? I could’ve gone pro if I didn’t become a civil servant!” He’d toss the baseball into his catcher’s glove a few times. “I’ve got to show the people I’m just like them, I love the sport and they should too, now Johnson..watch this.” He took a deep breath and began to step his way towards the pitcher’s mound, as he did, his security team began to move with him, he paused and held up his free hand, pointing for them to stop. As he made this gestures, the announcers for the game chimed in.\n\n “Ladies and Gentlemen, we welcome you to Diamond Stadium for our first game of the Professional Series, the Westopolis Comets will be going up against the To-Kyoto Dragons, but coming out to throw the first pitch of the series is our very own president, R. K Michael! Please give him a round of applause as he comes to the pitcher’s mound!”\n\nThe crowd most certainly cheered, mostly because a great deal of support for Michael’s campaign came from here, but others very much wanted to see a slightly older, portly fellow try to throw a baseball!\n\nIt was at about halfway that Michael realized how far away the pitcher’s mound was, and it was quite awhile since he had gotten up to some strenuous exercise. He wiped the sweat from his brow, and he already began to pant heavily. “Goodness me..I need to get in shape, I’m nearly dead before I get to the mound..” By the time he reached the mound, his face was as red as the uniforms of the Comets. He took a deep breath, eyeing up the catcher’s mound, where the Comet’s catcher resided, he was nervous about what was going to happen. The president took a pitcher’s stance, and lifted his left leg, before throwing the ball as hard as he could! The ball flew from the mound towards the catcher’s glove, it looked like it was going to make it! That was of course, before gravity did it’s work, and the ball fell, and fell, and fell..before landing about halfway between the mound and the catcher. The President held a look of exertion on his face, clearly not happy with that, but much to his surprise, the crowd cheered, with laughter sprinkled in between it. It appeared the crowd was rather good natured to him, and he put on one of his trademark smiles and held a hand up to the crowd, before nodding and making his way off the mound.\n\n“Oh blast it, it’s a long way back to the dugout…I’m gonna need something cold to drink and greasy to eat after this..”\n\n“Thank you very much Mr. President, now let’s play ball!”"
