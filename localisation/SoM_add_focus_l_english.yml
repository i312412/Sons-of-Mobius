 KOA_Alexanders_Legacy:0 "Alexander's Legacy"
 KOA_Alexanders_Legacy_desc:0 "King Alexander the Unifier was the first King of Acorn, who brought the tribes of Northamer together. We have seen his vision nearly die once before, but the kingdom will not fall while Max holds the throne."
 KOA_Theodores_Grief:0 "Theodore's Grief"
 KOA_Theodores_Grief_desc:0 "While his kingdom prospered, King Theodore the Bereaved lost his son to a tragic accident. An overlander youth shot his son, and Theodore closed borders with the Overland while mourning. We must ensure that our Kingdom will not be the victims of unknown weapons or be consumed by whatever tragedy may one day befall it."
 KOA_Raphaels_Preparations:0 "Raphael's Preparations"
 KOA_Raphaels_Preparations_desc:0 "King Raphael, second son of King Theodore, was forced to the throne as a child when his father died unexpectedly. He spent most of his reign preparing his child for his time in power. We must implement a draft and train the troops so that our soldiers are ready for future warfare."
 KOA_Studies_of_Julius:0 "Studies of Julius"
 KOA_Studies_of_Julius_desc:0 "King Julius the Enlightened (not to be confused with that traitor Robotnik) was the first to discover the Source of All, the heavenly force that brought us prosperity until its demise. While the Source of All may no longer be with us, we should still invest money into more mundane discoveries. Our enemies won’t stay idle, and neither should we."
 KOA_Constructions_of_Romulus:0 "Constructions of Romulus"
 KOA_Constructions_of_Romulus_desc:0 "King Romulus the Builder moved the capital to the Source of All’s resting place. He built up the power of the monarchy, as well as Mobotropolis itself. The decades have not been kind to our industry, but we must restore our production to the level at which we can compete with the Robosphere."
 KOA_Lessons_from_George:0 "Lessons from George"
 KOA_Lessons_from_George_desc:0 "For all of the respect you have for your predecessors, King George the Foolish earned his title by leading a disastrous war against the Overland and losing the support of his court in the process. Now we are in a situation where we too must gamble the support of the people, knowing that our favor has gone into decline. Taxes will have to be raised in expectation of a very just war. The people may not like it, but they will come to understand its necessity in time."
 KOA_Gifts_of_Abraham:0 "Gifts of Abraham"
 KOA_Gifts_of_Abraham_desc:0 "King Abraham the Generous rebuilt the trust of the masses by establishing the baronies and healing the wounds caused by King George’s Folly. Several of the Barons rebelled against the Kingdom and sided with the Overlanders during the Great War, so we will be far more careful with our generosity. Rewards will be given to the loyal. Treasoners will receive naught but the sword."
 KOA_Passion_of_Reginald:0 "Passion of Reginald"
 KOA_Passion_of_Reginald_desc:0 "King Reginald the Romantic got his name from his marriage to a woman he met while visiting the colony of Downunda and his love of the arts. He was a terrible poet, but the kingdom benefited from his appreciation of cultural explorations. War has strained the Kingdom of Acorn’s relationship with their colonial city of Priscilla for too long. Now they can once again benefit from our support and patronage."
 KOA_Strength_of_Silvanus:0 "Strength of Silvanus"
 KOA_Strength_of_Silvanus_desc:0 "While his actions to strengthen the Kingdom of Acorn made King Silvanus the Resolute a controversial figure, he did what he had to in order to prevent the Overland from preying upon any perceived weaknesses. We too will steel ourselves in expectation of the worst and protect our nation accordingly."
 KOA_Sebastians_Allies:0 "Sebastian’s Allies"
 KOA_Sebastians_Allies_desc:0 "The Adventurer King, Sebastian the Worldly, traveled the globe during his reign. His most notable accomplishment was supporting the O’Hedge family during the power struggle that consumed Eurish generations ago, securing the throne for his allies and giving birth to modern Mercia. The Kingdom of Acorn will reestablish ties with their old friends before trouble rears its ugly head again."
 KOA_Frederics_Open_Mind:0 "Frederic’s Open Mind"
 KOA_Frederics_Open_Mind_desc:0 "Father of Maximilian Acorn, King Frederic the Gracious was the first king to give an earnest effort at peace with the Overland. That peace was never to be, but the humans of the United Federation have proven to be trustworthy allies against Robotnik’s regime. It would not hurt to strengthen those ties in expectation of further hardship."
 KOA_Maximilians_Remorse:0 "Maximilian’s Remorse"
 KOA_Maximilians_Remorse_desc:0 "King Maximilian is not so far gone that he is unaware of his title: King Max the Cursed. He owns his great error in trusting Doctor Robotnik with the keys to his kingdom and the atrocities Julian committed with them. He placed his trust in the wrong people too many times before, but not this time. Before he steps down, his kingdom will be ready to make Eggman bleed!"
 KOA_Gift_to_Elias:0 "Gift to Elias"
 KOA_Gift_to_Elias_desc:0 "We have done everything we could to prepare the Kingdom of Acorn for its next heir. King Max feels the exhaustion from his long years of strife, and has come to the end of his reign. He will step down in favor of his son, and Elias Acorn will lead the kingdom towards a new era."
 KOA_Put_Out_The_Fires:0 "Put Out the Fires"
 KOA_Put_Out_The_Fires_desc:0 "To say that King Elias’ coronation is a contentious event would be an understatement. People are mad and things aren’t likely to get better in the coming days, so we must do everything possible to ensure that our regime remains stable. Pose for pictures, shake hands, kiss babies, anything to convince the populace that King Elias was the proper choice for Max’s successor."
 KOA_Ease_the_Concerns:0 "Ease the Concerns"
 KOA_Ease_the_Concerns_desc:0 "The people have no reason to be concerned! King Elias is a kind and generous ruler who only wants what’s best for his kingdom, even if that requires a few hard decisions to be made. We may live in challenging times, but we’ve endured worse! Compared to our struggles under Robotnik, a simple regime change is nothing! Ignore the doubters, Elias is the only one who can lead us to the future!"
 KOA_Silence_the_Doubters:0 "Silence the Doubters"
 KOA_Silence_the_Doubters_desc:0 "There have been some unfortunate naysayers to the king's ascension that refuse to be reasoned with. Ignore their doomsaying, as their negativity is poisoning the discourse for everyone. Elias is king. What other options are there but to have faith in the fact that our regent will lead us to victory? Suggestions to those alternatives will not be tolerated in the streets of New Mobotropolis."
 KOA_Support_Worker_Rights:0 "Support Worker Rights"
 KOA_Support_Worker_Rights_desc:0 "Rumors of slackening safety regulations and mounting worker complaints in the factories have reached Castle Acorn. This is unacceptable. If we allow our people to toil like slaves in our factories, how are we better than our enemies? Our workers are our subjects. They have well earned a set of basic rights to keep them safe from hazardous work conditions and exploitative wages."
 KOA_Negotiate_with_Union_Leaders:0 "Negotiate with Union Leaders"
 KOA_Negotiate_with_Union_Leaders_desc:0 "We have become aware of larger movers and shakers at work in the growing labor unions of the Titanium Belt. It would do well to make contact with these influential union leaders to ensure that the needs of the kingdom's industrial workers are properly met, though they may be skeptical at first of the new regent's intentions for them."
 KOA_Suppress_Organized_Labor:0 "Suppress Organized Labor"
 KOA_Suppress_Organized_Labor_desc:0 "The factory workers of the North have started to form cliques and undermine our efforts to prepare the country for Eggman's eventual attack. This cannot stand. We will muster a garrison to halt these activities and provide incentives for more workers to leave their seditious activities."
 KOA_Bust_Northern_Unions:0 "Bust Northern Unions"
 KOA_Bust_Northern_Unions_desc:0 "It is no big secret that there are leaders organizing the worker strikes and acts of sabotage that have become a growing issue in the Titanium Belt. Increase the pressure on the Northamer unions and arrest the leaders before their actions cause anyone else to get hurt."
 KOA_Uphold_Barony_System:0 "Uphold Barony System"
 KOA_Uphold_Barony_System_desc:0 "While the betrayals committed by some barons during the Great War have caused some to question the value of keeping them around, the Southern Baronies have been an institution for centuries. To revoke the hereditary rights of those barons who survived and remained loyal would ruffle the fur of the few Southern nobles that remain. We will announce that the Barony system is being upheld as before to prevent them from getting any wrong ideas."
 KOA_Appeal_to_Populists:0 "Appeal to Populists"
 KOA_Appeal_to_Populists_desc:0 "As shown by the tales of kings past (and the king that recently retired), a disconnect with the wants and needs of the people can be disastrous. Lend an ear to the requests of the more active populist movements in the Southern Baronies. If we can win back the crowd, we can win back the kingdom!"
 KOA_Sideline_the_Barons:0 "Sideline the Barons"
 KOA_Sideline_the_Barons_desc:0 "The Southern Barons have been unreliable in the past. To let them get too powerful means that their loyalty to the Kingdom of Acorn may start to slip like it did when the Overland offered to split the country fifty-fifty. Limit the influence of the surviving Barons and keep their powers in check to prevent anything like that from happening again."
 KOA_Revoke_Baron_Titles:0 "Revoke Baron Titles"
 KOA_Revoke_Baron_Titles:0 "The baronies are an antiquated system that serves only to take undue power from the king and invite the barons to organize against their kingdom. Curtailing the barons' influence on the South is the first step to properly reintegrating the Baronies back into the Kingdom of Acorn."
 KOA_Nationalize_Businesses:0 "Nationalize Businesses"
 KOA_Nationalize_Businesses_desc:0 "To ensure no undue disruption of the kingdom’s access to vital resources, we will begin nationalizing key industries that have not already fallen under the crown’s purview. The owners of these businesses will be compensated as fairly as can be managed, but the Kingdom of Acorn will hold on to these assets to prevent their misuse."
 KOA_Encourage_Public_Works:0 "Encourage Public Works"
 KOA_Encourage_Public_Works_desc:0 "New Mobotropolis is built on a flexible structure of nanites that can be reshaped to suit our needs, but the rest of the kingdom’s infrastructure is well overdue for improvement. We will start a series of public works projects to bring the nation closer to the heights of the Golden Age. Or at least, beyond what the Kingdom of Acorn standard has been for the past few centuries."
 KOA_Support_Privatization:0 "Support Privatization"
 KOA_Support_Privatization_desc:0 "Granting private enterprises the authority to build vital infrastructure at the crown’s behest will allow us to free up resources that would be better used elsewhere. While the kingdom should be wary about entrusting those services to foreign companies, a degree of competition between Northamer-based ventures can help keep them at a reliable level of quality."
 KOA_Privatize_the_Mining_Industry:0 "Privatize the Mining Industry"
 KOA_Privatize_the_Mining_Industry_desc:0 "Our earlier efforts in opening the kingdom to new avenues of commerce have thus far borne fruit. Why stop there? While it is an unconventional decision, the prospect of privatizing the traditionally state-owned mining industry shows much promise."
 KOA_Promote_the_Loyal:0 "Promote the Loyal"
 KOA_Promote_the_Loyal_desc:0 "Trust is a fickle thing. To ensure that our trust in the army is unshakable, we will prioritize the promotion of soldiers with strong loyalty to the crown over sheer skill or talent. The strength of our army may suffer due to the more stringent screening of the officers, but we are better off with a loyal army than a fair-weather one."
 KOA_Root_Out_Republicans:0 "Root Out Republicans"
 KOA_Root_Out_Republicans_desc:0 "The regime change and recent policy changes have motivated a small group of soldiers to resign. There have been reports of these soldiers associating with a growing group of "republicans" spreading revolutionary propaganda. We know not who is leading these radicals or their overall agenda, but if they seek to subvert our armed forces they must be stopped at all costs!"
 KOA_Promote_The_Best:0 "Promote the Best"
 KOA_Promote_The_Best_desc:0 "While we do not wish to fill our ranks with soldiers that are disloyal, we cannot allow a fear of "divided loyalties" in the army to blind us from pragmatic decision making. We will promote officers based on performance and performance alone. Their effectiveness as a fighting force will not be placed second to anything."
 KOA_True_Meritocracy:0 "True Meritocracy"
 KOA_True_Meritocracy_desc:0 "With proper, non-corrupt officials currently in place, our army now prioritizes excellence over any petty political disputes. Hopefully, over time, our once divided army can now proudly unite under one flag, and be a well-trained, intimidating force to all of Mobius."
 KOA_The_Acorn_Civil_War:0 "The Acorn Civil War"
 KOA_The_Acorn_Civil_War_desc:0 "So this is what it has come to. If Amadeus wants anarchy and civil war, then we shall raise our guns and fight! We go to war to protect the kingdom! He and any other anarchist traitors who seek to tarnish the Acorns’ glory will be destroyed!"
 KOA_Our_Friends_at_Home:0 "Our Friends at Home"
 KOA_Our_Friends_at_Home_desc:0 "We must win the hearts & minds of our subjects. The royal guard, the freedom fighters, and the common folk must band together in order to win this war for the Acorn family."
 KOA_Rally_the_Royal_Guard:0 "Rally the Royal Guard"
 KOA_Rally_the_Royal_Guard_desc:0 "The kingdom has been weakened by the fact we have lost many gifted soldiers to Amadeus’ rebel army, but the illustrious royal guard remains ever-loyal. United the scattered members of the guards into an organized fighting force to take back the kingdom!"
 KOA_Acorn_Militias:0 "Acorn Militias"
 KOA_Acorn_Militias_desc:0 "Not only must our trained soldiers take up arms. In expectation that the enemy will try to attack us where we are most vulnerable, we shall train militia groups to better protect their homes and loved ones."
 KOA_Returning_Expatriates:0 "Returning Expatriates"
 KOA_Returning_Expatriates_desc:0 "TBW"
 KOA_Nanite_Citadel:0 "Nanite Citadel"
 KOA_Nanite_Citadel_desc:0 "New Mobotropolis must be ready for anything that can be thrown at it. While we did not expect that to include our own people, the best way to do so would be to expand the limits of NICOLE’s nanite city. It would increase our industry and defenses for every inch of land converted."
 KOA_Kingdoms_Arsenal:0 "Kingdom’s Arsenal"
 KOA_Kingdoms_Arsenal_desc:0 "The crown engineers and weaponers are capable of designing great and varied war machines, though they have thus far fettered their inventions in order to limit the bloodshed. We must expand our range of weapons and our willingness to use them if we are to keep our heads above water during this conflict."
 KOA_Exploit_Power_Rings:0 "Exploit Power Rings"
 KOA_Exploit_Power_Rings_desc:0 "Power rings are one of the most wondrous and vital resources the Kingdom of Acorn has. Their magical properties to give strength, wisdom, and healing do not come cheap or easily. We shall collect these golden rings from their varied hiding places and prioritize their use in the war."
 KOA_Sallys_Operations_Manual:0 "Sally’s Operations Manual"
 KOA_Sallys_Operations_Manual_desc:0 "The kingdom has reactivated its backup special forces, but they aren’t enough to meet the military intelligence demands of this war. Now, more so than ever, we must continue to train new freedom fighters so that they may better act as well-rounded operatives in the service of the crown. Sally wrote the book on being a freedom fighter, and we’re teaching from it!"
 KOA_Secret_Freedom_Fighters_CW:0 "Secret Freedom Fighters"
 KOA_Secret_Freedom_Fighters_CW_desc:0 "For better or worse, the kingdom’s greatest agents, the freedom fighters, are celebrated heroes. Their faces and talents are well-known by the world at large, lowering their effectiveness in covert operations. The freedom fighters have also shown great reluctance in using their full abilities against former friends and Acorn citizens, further limiting their use in this war.\nFor this, Harvey Who has the solution. Freedom fighters that, by all accounts, do not exist. Their duties will be as varied, dangerous, and confidential. Some missions may require them to cross lines for the good of the country. Not a single member will receive public accommodations for their sacrifices until long after the war is over.\nWere Elias not already burdened with the matters of state, he would be leading them himself."
 KOA_Sword_of_Acorn:0 "Sword of Acorn"
 KOA_Sword_of_Acord_desc:0 "The Sword of Acorn is more than a weapon. It is more than a symbol of unity or authority. An instrument of righteousness, the Sword was crafted by the Ancient Walkers to hold back the darkness and smite evil. With the full support of his subjects and a renewed resolve to end the war, Elias will allow this holy blade to leave its sheath. Whether one of his generals or Elias himself is the one to wield it in battle, the Sword of Acorn is ready to once again see combat."
 KOA_Our_Allies_Abroad:0 "Our Allies Abroad"
 KOA_Our_Allies_Abroad_desc:0 "The Acorns do not stand alone in their time of need. They are allied with the human coalition of the United Federation and the genteel country of Mercia, among other allies the Freedom Fighters have gained over the years."
 KOA_UF_Military_Advisors:0 "U.F. Military Advisors"
 KOA_UF_Military_Advisors_desc:0 "We have come far since Max stepped down from power, but the United Federation is still many years ahead of us in military theory. They have the experience with modern weapons and modern war that we do not. As such, we must request advisors from G.U.N. be flown to New Mobotropolis and teach our troops how to win a modern conflict."

In addition, our assistance in resolving local conflicts will help stabilize the region."

 KOA_Convince_the_Stubborn_desc:0 "Despite our peace initiatives, not everyone will be willing to play by the new rules. The revanchist regimes of Psarska and Olppaon, Criardia and Pirenia believe that their problems can only be solved by war. We will certainly try to listen to their demands, but we will not allow them to continue escalating conflicts. Even if it requires a military invasion."

 KOA_Assist_in_Deroboticization_desc:0 "At the moment, we are almost the only country on the continent capable of deroboticizing Robians on an industrial scale. This may impose a certain responsibility on us, but it also serves as our trump card - it solidifies our messianic role in the region. We can offer this kind of assistance in exchange for certain concessions, of course."
 KOA_Huboulian_Bases:0 "Hiboulian Bases"
 KOA_Huboulian_Bases_desc:0 "Hiboulia is a special country in the north of Northamer. It is the only one on the continent that has adopted a socialist course of development, being the most developed small nation. In addition, its southern borders rest on the Eggman Empire. The Hiboulians share the same geopolitical interest with us in keeping ourselves safe from Robotnik. Since we have established friendly relations with the main socialist regime of Mobius, we can offer Hboulia additional guarantees in exchange for military preferences of a known kind."
 KOA_Pacify_the_Region:0 "Pacify the Region"
 KOA_Pacify_the_Region_desc:0 "Our presence in the region is enough to influence relations between the countries. To achieve an atmosphere of peace and cooperation, it remains to achieve the integration of our neighbors into the Freedom Accord, forming a united front against Robotnik. Is this not a step toward the dream of Alexander the Unifier? Time will tell."

 KOA_Infiltrate_Studiopolis_desc:0 "Everyone knows what dirty dealings take place in Studiopolis, but no one has the strength or desire to compete with the financial empire of media elites who perform an outright spying function for various criminal regimes. There have been at least eight known cases of leaks of military secrets after visits by correspondents from Studiopolis to military installations. It's time to take control of this vicious city."
 KOA_Swartzland_Brothers:0 "Swartzland Brothers"
 KOA_Swartzland_Brothers_desc:0 "Finally, we must remember our main ally, our little brother, Swarzland. Depending on who is now leading our country, we should be concerned about the fate of this proud industrial giant. And at the same time strengthen our dynasty in place, if it is still in power. The forces of the Reichsmacht will be an important factor in further wars in which we will be involved."
 KOA_The_Big_Uncle:0 "The Big Uncle"
 KOA_The_Big_Uncle_desc:0 "The United Federation was with us in a difficult time and did much to protect our freedom and our interests during the Second Robotnik War. We can develop and deepen our cooperation so that both great powers may reap the fruits of a great friendship. There is much to be learned by our military from the G.U.N., and it will take a great deal of help to rebuild and increase our industrial capacity."
 KOA_GUN_Lessons:0 "G.U.N. Lessons"
 KOA_GUN_Lessons_desc:0 "Both technically and technologically, the G.U.N., as the armed forces of the United Federation, serve as an example to many. They have the most advanced stock of military robotics in Free Mobius and, in addition, have one of the strongest intelligence agencies. The G.U.N. specialists will help us in military construction, and they themselves will gain valuable experience from joint exercises with our troops."
 KOA_Robots_on_Robots:0 "Robots on Robots"
 KOA_Robots_on_Robots_desc:0 "We should not sacrifice only the lives of Mobians in exchange for the destruction of Robotnik units. We are trading lives for an easily replenishable resource, and this arrangement may not suit everyone. Fortunately, the G.U.N. may have the answer to our requests - we will enter into a new arms contract, focusing on robotic systems. G.U.N.'s first-class robotics will be a great addition to our major units."
 KOA_Bills_on_Bills:0 "Bills on Bills"
 KOA_Bills_on_Bills_desc:0 "Financial transactions between our nations are increasing, but until then we have not paid our debts.

 KOA_Chips_on_Chips:0 "Chips on Chips"
 KOA_Chips_on_Chips_desc:0 "We continue to be fascinated by man's innovative approach to programmable electronics, but we are determined to catch up and overtake the Federation in this area. Perhaps the research in this direction, carried out jointly with scientists from the United Federation, will lead us to new scientific breakthroughs, perhaps bringing us to the frontier of the development of artificial intelligence, not inferior to the capabilities of NICOLE whose mystery has not been revealed yet."

 KOA_Live_and_Learn_desc:0 "Sonic and Shadow join forces for the first time, saving Mobius from the threat of Gerald Robotnik's posthumous revenge. Shadow sacrificed himself but survived, crossing paths again and again with our agents on operations against Robotnik.

 KOA_Rally_for_Richard_desc:0 "Swartzland Acorns are the major part of our empire. They have industrial giants and tens of millions of subjects. However, the situation is uncertain since Wiktor I Acorn has been assassinated. The fate of our devout ally is questioned by numerous internal struggles among various political forces from nationalists to communists and from technocrats to monarchists. The only lawful successor, however, is obvious - Reinhard I Acorn must lead the Reich, and nobody else."

 KOA_Reichsmacht_at_Service_desc:0 "The Reichsmacht has gone through years of evolution. From a decentralized army of the various imperial lands it becomes a real force, equipped with the latest technology and trained by the best specialists. In future wars the Reichsmacht should become the decisive strike force of the Acorn Empire. We will invite the best officers to New Mobotropolis for a conference and consider joint exercises."
 KOA_Flugwaffe_Mission:0 "Flügwaffe Mission"
 KOA_Flugwaffe_Mission_desc:0 "The Flügwaffe, like the Reichsmacht, is not without potential.  The Swartzland Bombing Air Force - has every chance of being the best in the Freedom Accord. The predatory nature of the Flügwaffe pilots can benefit us in many tactical and strategic aspects of air warfare. We just need to channel it in the right direction. Also, a prominent avanturist has a proposal..."
 KOA_Industrial_Imperialism:0 "Industrial Imperialism"
 KOA_Industrial_Imperialism_desc:0 "Industrial imperialism sounds ridiculous as a concept.

 KOA_Question_of_Colonies:0 "Question of Colonies"
 KOA_Question_of_Colonies_desc:0 "Despite their dependent position, the Black Forest Acorns did not feel constrained in any way when it came to colonizing the southern states. The small, but firmly held colonial empire of the Swartzlanders brings certain benefits and shows the prestige of the Kaiser. Nevertheless, it still costs us and our brethren a great deal to maintain the colonies, and the United Federation clearly resents the colonial policy."
 KOA_The_Iron_Acorn:0 "The Iron Acorn"
 KOA_The_Iron_Acorn_desc:0 "Our service to the Swartzlanders is hard to overestimate, and they recognize it. The King and the Kaiser both deserve the highest state honors for the contribution they have made to the development of Adlin's relationship with New Mobotropolis. The ceremony of awarding Elias with the Iron Acorn will confirm the status of the older branch of Acorn in the eyes of the younger one."
 KOA_Spread_the_Word:0 "Spread The Word"
 KOA_Spread_the_Word_desc:0 "Many of our subjects around the world have hopelessly lost faith in the Crown of Acorn. They believed we would never regain our greatness, never again be able to keep the common people of Mobius safe.

 KOA_To_Jewel_of_Bharatsha:0 "To Jewel of Bharatsha"
 KOA_To_Jewel_of_Bharatsha_desc:0 "The richest lands of Bharatsha became the pride of Acorn's colonial policy. The Maharaja has long been trying to stabilize a country mired in hunger riots and ethnic conflicts, and without our help order in these lands could simply collapse. They have forgotten what the crown has done for them since 3000. It's time we remind them."
 KOA_To_Mercian_Waves:0 "To Mercian Waves"
 KOA_To_Mercian_Waves_desc:0 "The Kingdom of Mercia had a special place in the sphere of influence of the Kingdom of Acorn. Ever since King Sebastian Acorn put the O'Hedge dynasty on the throne, the kingdoms have been fraternal. No wonder we've had to share a common sorrow with the Mercians in the form of enslavement by Robotnik. In spite of this, the people of Mercia drove the tyrants out, but many problems remained. We wouldn't be Acorns if we didn't step in and solve them."
 KOA_To_Hills_of_Downunda:0 "To Hills of Downunda"
 KOA_To_Hills_of_Downunda_desc:0 "Downunda is a distant land that entered the realm of the Akorns in the time of Sebastian Acorn. In ancient times there was an Echidna civilization here, and during the First Robotnik War fuel for the Ultimate Annihilator was mined here. It is difficult to overestimate the importance of this distant region to the Acorn Empire. And now, despite the appearance of peace and tranquility, the situation in Downunda is now very unstable."
 KOA_To_Jade_Dragon:0 "The Jade Dragon"
 KOA_To_Jade_Dragon_desc:0 "Wulongyuan has been in a state of fragmentation and war for half a century. Despite this, none of the states formed in the chaos has severed ties with the outside world, and our merchants still have interests here. But the main defender of our interests is undoubtedly the Free People and their army of Aiguojun. Monkey Khan has received our assistance in the war with the Iron Dominion before, but it is not over. In addition, the Communist forces of the region are capable of undermining our influence in the region. We must intervene."
 KOA_We_the_Empire:0 "We, the Empire"
 KOA_We_the_Empire_desc:0 "Our place in the world should be obvious to everyone. We are an empire, but not in the sense that freethinking Mobians would reproach us. We are the heart of the world, and we become the force that brings it into balance. This is Alexander the Liberator's dream, and such are Elias's aspirations. Where the Acorn flag has been raised, it must no longer descend."
 KOA_Mutual_Settlements:0 "Mutual Settlements"
 KOA_Mutual_Settlements_desc:0 "Relations with the United States are not easy. Obviously, we have common geopolitical interests, but underneath them there is ground for disagreement. The world is too small for two empires. The Federation would like to see us more dependent, and we do not want G.U.N. interference in our internal affairs. Are we on our way with their democratic rhetoric?"
 KOA_Traitorous_Race:0 "Traitorous Race"
 KOA_Traitorous_Race_desc:0 "Such a stab in the back was to be expected from Overlanders, but from humans? They're all in it together. All our fears in their direction were confirmed by practice, when they went against us at a difficult time for us. We'll never be allies with them again, and they're no better than Robotnik. Who knows what else we can expect from this Federation?"
 KOA_Nationalize_Federal_Assets:0 "Nationalise Federal Assets"
 KOA_Nationalize_Federal_Assets_desc:0 "The corporations of the United Federation have invested a lot of money in our economy. They thought that we would become less independent, that we would henceforth be led by their economic programs and allow them to profit from our resources. Enough for us! Our Mobians will work our land for our interests, and let the human bankers look for other places to invest their capital."

 KOA_Recall_the_Great_War_desc:0 "They used to surpass us in technology, but that has changed. We can combine our modern technology with the biological advantages of the Mobians.

The veterans of that war are still alive, and they will have something to tell our brave soldiers in military exercises."
 KOA_Unneccessary_Escalation:0 "Unnecessary Escalation"
 KOA_Unneccessary_Escalation_desc:0 "We've sat on a powder keg, and we can't get off it. The Mobian soldier looks aggressively at the human soldier on the other side of the border day after day, waiting for a battle alert. Military plans in both countries are being prepared. Although there are Mobians on the other side, they too will have to realize how great a delusion it was on their part to trust humans. The only answer to all the questions is near..."

 KOA_A_Friend_to_Rely_On_desc:0 "Despite our suspicions, people have proven that they can be useful. Given the situation we find ourselves in, sticking together for now is better than trying to survive on our own. We have more than one common enemy, so a joint strategy is needed to secure our interests on Mobius. Then we can settle things diplomatically."
 KOA_Share_Markets:0 "Share Markets"
 KOA_Share_Markets_desc:0 "In spite of all the differences in values, we value one thing: a business approach. Give and take. Our aristocratic trading magnates have much to offer the companies of the Federation, and they have plenty of money that could be put to good use in our economy. We'll open markets and help trade put everything in its place without forcing us to exhaust ourselves with self-sufficiency policies."
 KOA_Armanent_Shipments:0 "Armament Shipments"
 KOA_Armanent_Shipments_desc:0 "Weapons of the United Federation are known for their high quality. They have plenty of them in storage, and our army's rearmament plans include a complete re-equipping of the troops with modern weapons.

 KOA_Welcome_to_Accord_desc:0 "All this time the United Federation has been only an observer in the Freedom Accord, not considering it its duty to take a direct part in its affairs and only supporting us militarily when it has been urgently needed.

 RCR_Great_Purge:0 "The Great Purge"
 RCR_Great_Purge_desc:0 "With their leaders arrested, we must now look through the lower echelons of the RCSR for these Reactionary Elements.

 RCR_Welcome_to_GULag_desc:0 "As we continue to locate more and more of the reactionary elements within our own borders, it has become increasingly clear that we cannot simply execute all of them, at least not all at once.

To this end we plan to establish the General Department of Camps, GULag for short, in order to punish the revolution’s enemies and create a source of cheap labour."

 RCR_Total_Censor_desc:0 "Poets, Authors, Philosophers. These occupations have their uses, but they are starting to overstay their welcome.

 UFA_Search_Alternate_Energy_Supplies_desc:0 "Jakalstan is a major supplier of our oil, but not the only one. Through development of our our reverves, careful politicking, and a willingness to pay through the nose, we can acquire enough oil to maintain vital economic processes."

 UFA_Move_into_Renewables_desc:0 "If there’s one thing we can learn from the Mobians, it’s how to better center our economy around sustainable options. It may be somewhat… embarrassing to turn to our woodland friends after we had spent so long dismissing their offers, but needs must. For a greener tomorrow! …and a powered today."

 UFA_Purchase_Power_Rings_desc:0 "Power Rings are rare, expensive, and only partially understood. The knowledge to produce them artificially has been lost to us, and they occur naturally only in rare and sought after ring lakes. Regardless, we already utilize what rings are within our control to power the Chaos Drives within our automated forces, making the adoption of further rings to fulfil our energy needs easy. They could represent a perfect stopgap solution… if we are willing to pay their exorbitant cost to black market salesmen or foolhardy adventurers."
 UFA_Calm_Populace:0 "Calm the Populace"
 UFA_Calm_Populace_desc:0 "The oil crisis is as much a social problem as it is a resource problem. The more our people panic, the more they add to public unrest and cause ever further crisis escalation. We must share with our citizens the many steps we have taken to combat this crisis and downplay the severity of the coming storm. If we can keep social order secure, we will then be able to solve the root of the issue."
 UFA_Situation_Stabilizes:0 "The Situation Stabilizes"
 UFA_Situation_Stabilizes_desc:0 "We have successfully mitigated the most immediate effects of the oil crisis. Shops remain open, the military remains functional, and the stock market is jumpy but not in freefall. Through alternative energy sources and careful public relations, we have ensured that the crisis will not escalate… yet. A more permanent solution must eventually be found. For now though, we can turn our attention to election season; and hope that when it ends, it will be our administration to find that solution."
