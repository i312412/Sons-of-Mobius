RCR_leader_bio:0 "Yuriy Alexandrovich Lebedev was born to a hereditary officer and a university professor. Since childhood he was surrounded by the children of socialists, getting closer to them, studying the teachings of Heinrich Katzer, playing war games with them and unsuspecting that many of them would become his comrades after little more than ten years. Nevertheless, his father's grip led the would-be revolutionary into the army of the Rethenian Republic at the end of the Great War and the beginning of the First Robotnik war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_Pallasov_pic_2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n He caught the fall of his native country under the merciless onslaught of Robotnik, and he had to join forces with a large group of his compatriots as a platoon commander to wage guerrilla war against the invader. Thus, under the pseudonym of "Pallasov" he had become one of the commanders of the Rethenian Freedom Fighters, and under his command, the Red Guard of Freedom Fighters freed Stalegor from the pro-Robotnik regime. Soon after the country's liberation from the Robotnik Empire, Comrade Pallasov was one of the most influential persons in the country, leading the left-wing faction of the unstable coalition government. The Cold Hunger, the collapse of the industrial production, conflicts over land property and the subsequent collapse of the government led to civil war, which began as an aftermath the New Year Revolution, when Pallasov gave the Red Guards command to open fire on government troops who were trying to disperse the strike at the Arsenal plant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n£GFX_Pallasov_pic_1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      §gThis is when the Rethenian Council Socialist Republic was born.§! \n\nPallasov led the Red Army and government institutions of the Council Rethenia actively, often going on the battlefield and using his magnetic super abilities, which very soon exhausted his nervous system. Severe illness caught Pallasov soon after the defeat of the reactionary forces of Rethenia in 3233, forcing the chairman of the Sovnarkom to retreat from political life for two and a half years. Unfortunately, in his absence, there was a rift in the ruling RPRA party, and under conditions of intra-party conflicts no one could stop the disintegration processes in the local Councils. Now that Pallasov has returned from his treatment, he is ready to continue the struggle for the liberation of the workers of all Mobius.§!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
