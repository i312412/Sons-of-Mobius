    koa.1.d:0 "The Kingdom of Acorn remained the beacon of hope of the entire Mobian world for many centuries, and the Crown of the Acorns enjoyed authority throughout all Mobius. In 2320, Alexander Acorn, inspired by the contacts with the echidna civilization, entered into an alliance with several tribal leaders, who soon afterwards elected him as their king. 'Tis when Alexander Acorn was henceforth known as “King Alexander the Unifier”, which marked the beginning of the Acorn Dynasty. Then, Alexander set out to unite all the peoples of the Mobian Oekumene into one state to enjoy the common prosperity. Even though he failed to persuade the proud and warlike echidnas and the Overlanders to join the Kingdom of Acorn, the rest of the Mobian principalities willingly allied with the new dynasty, receiving protection and provisions in return. \n\nThe echidnas remained neutral to Alexander’s Big Game, but the Overlanders took an aggressive stance. After an Overlander accidentally shot Prince Emerson Acorn, the son of Alexander, King Theodore the Bereaved broke all diplomatic relations with the Overlanders, closed the borders and banned all firearms. Since then, the Acorns and Overlanders had a history of run-ins, but this did not stop the Acorns from building a powerful empire over which the sun never set.\n\nThe Acorns were famous for their political wisdom and kindness, but like any other dynasty, even they experienced difficulties. The development of industrial production and the formation of capitalism in the vassal countries undermined the foundations of the entire system of the Empire. National liberation bourgeois revolutions took place all over the empire, for which the conservative Acorns were practically unprepared. One of the few who met the challenges of the time was King Frederick the Gracious, who invited the scientists of the Overlanders and the Order of Naugus to the country. \n\nThe Overlanders pursue industrialization and boosted technological progress, prompting Naugus, the Royal Wizard of the Acorns, to provoke a war to get rid of the Overlanders, whose technology depreciated his magic. As soon as Maximilian Acorn ascended to the throne in 3215, the Great War, provoked by Naugus and his accomplices, began, in it the Overlanders clashed in a fierce battle with the Mobians."

Грохот разорвавшейся взрывчатки и поднявшееся в небо облако дыма в условиях продолжающейся войны с Эггманом вселило панику в горожан, ранее ожидавших, что война уже не вернется в столицу Королевства. В прочем, как оказалось впоследствии, страхи горожан не оправдались. Взрыв раздался со стороны предместий центра заключения, совсем недалеко от стен исправительного учреждения. На удивление, не пострадал никто кроме одной крайне весомой цели - колдун Иксис Нагус. Совершенно неожиданный для него взрыв не оставил ему ни единого шанса на выживание. Хоть само его тело не поддавалось распознанию, ряд разбросанных вокруг места взрыва атрибутов позволял точно определить, что погиб именно колдун. Многие желали смерти Иксису Нагусу с тех пор, как общественность узнала о его преступлениях в попытках захватить престол. Боевые организации СРМ и Золотого Легиона одновременно взяли на себя ответственность за это убийство, пытаясь на этой почве завоевать политические очки, но СМИ опровергли их причастность. Это событие положило конец всем дворцовым интригам, учинённым колдуном, и его смерть вселила спокойствие в сознание подданых Акорнов."

    koa.4.d:0 "Увы, мир меняется, и печальна участь тех монархов, которые не осознают этого. Ещё во время Великой войны и Первой войны Роботника никто и не думал о революции. Король Максимилиан Акорн был поддержан всеми слоями населения в этой борьбе, но Вторая война Роботника, настолько бездарно начатая и нерешительно продолжавшаяся вплоть до уничтожения Нотхолла - исторического сердца национально-освободительной борьбы подданных Акорнов, - вывалила на стол весь пучок противоречий и проблем, развившихся в обществе Королевства.\nЭта война поставила под сомнение способность абсолютной монархии адекватно справляться с ситуацией. Вместе с позорными поражениями Королевской Армии Акорнам припомнили теперь упадок отечественной промышленности, неспособной конкурировать с продукцией Соединенной Федерации, и повальную коррупцию, и неспособность урегулировать ситуацию с отказывающимися платить налоги южными баронами, и полное игнорирование проблем подданных. Против благородных фамилий в суде всякий подданный был бессилен. После Первой войны Роботника наступил новый сельскохозяйственный кризис, который хоть и не привел к такому повальному голоду, как в Ретении годами раннее, но снова вогнал страну в долги и поставил под сомнение осмысленность дальнейших войн за честь короны Акорнов. «Технологический консерватизм» - еще одна причина недовольства промышленной буржуазии подданства Эйкорнов. Вместо свободного расширения капитала они вынуждены считаться с тормозящими промышленность «мобианские» ценности по сбережению природы, в результате чего Оверлэндеры давно превзошли мобианцев технологически и экономически. Демократ требует создания республики, чтобы снять регрессивные квоты на промышленное строительство, в один голос с генералом Амадеем Прауэром, вернувшегося с планеты Аргентум из изгнания вместе со своей женой.\nНесмотря на проделанные на Юге реформы, сепаратистские настроения не только не ослабли, но и усилились, перерастая в радикальные и экстремистские требования об изменения порядка на всех землях, которые сейчас находятся в подданстве Акорнов. Взирая позорное отступление Королевской Армии второй половины прошлого года, брошенные на погибель под стальным катком Эггмана южане сильно разочаровались в королевской власти. Разнородные политические силы Юга объединились в один альянс, от плутократической Конфедерации Южных Баронов, возглавляемой бароном Додвардом, до национал-популистской организации "Золотой Легион" Мэттью Натшелла.\nРабочий вопрос в Королевстве Акорнов не решался никоим образом. Если с начала Великой войны до конца Первой войны Роботника до этого никому не было дела, то теперь, когда миллионы рабочих Титановго пояса возвращаются домой и сталкиваются с полным бесправием, безработицей и нищетой, рабочий класс начинает задумываться о необходимости повторения ретенского опыта. Джек СиндиКэт, амбициозный адвокат и профсоюзный лидер, уже преуспел в объединении всех социалистических организаций в Союз Рабочих Мобиуса, и теперь ищет путей для соглашения с генералом Прауэром."

Будучи выходцем из простого народа и одним из самых храбрых стрелков Борцов за Свободу Юга, Хонг снискал славу как среди обездоленных крестьян, так и среди зарождающейся южной промышленной буржуазии. В результате последней реформы территориального управления 3235 года Хонг смог прорваться на пост через демократические выборы.

Оно распадается, потому что кучка аристократов жирует, пока трудолюбивые крестьяне обнашивают лохмотья десятки лет. Оно распадается, потому что наша родина уже давно продана корпорациям Оверлэндеров. Оно распадается, потому что один процент населения владеет всем, а все остальные - ничем! Никто владеет всем - и все остальные владеют ничем. Эра Акорнов подходит к концу, потому что ушла в небытие эпоха их честности и добродетели. Красно-чёрные бандиты, проплаченные Палласовым, орудуют на севере, и в этом виноваты бароны. Вместе с ними цепные псы генерала Прауэра ведут террор от имени корпораций. Акорны игнорируют тот факт, что аристократы и олигархи сдирают с наш шкуру. Граждане Нортамера! Я верю, что в один момент мы станем гражданами, членами одной семьи, придерживающейся вековых традиций справедливости. Я готов заявить смело: мы будем королями своей жизни, и мы ни дадим себе притеснять никого, ни дадим никому притеснять честных мобианцев!"\n\nРечь была отмечена бурными овациями и апплодисментами. Хонг давал автографы своей роботизированной рукой всем желающим. Речь вызвала бурную реакцию в СМИ и поизвела колассальный эффект на многие города и деревни Южных Баронств. Даже за пределами Юга Королевства у Хонга появляются сторонники. Растущая популярность южного популиста стала ярким свидетельством радикализации всех слоев общества Нортамера..."

His mind was not spared from the ravages of these hardships, but he knew in his heart that his time on the throne was nearing its end.\nHis son Elias would be the next king. He was inexperienced, but Max knew that Elias had the strong will needed to lead their people through the coming dark times. King Maz had no doubts that his daughter Sally would be a model queen if anything were to happen to Elias, but tradition dictated she must wed before assuming power. Now that Prince Elias was an eligible heir, Max no longer sought to pressure Sally into what should always have been her own decision.\nOr perhaps he discovered a spark of sentimentality in his otherwise bitter bouts of senility.

It seemed as though, for the first time in years, the Kingdom of Acorn truly had a second chance to pick itself up off the ground and grow anew.\nNICOLE did the heavy lifting, but that did not mean the work was done. The Kingdom of Acorn had always been wary of reckless expansion and industrialization, witnessing firsthand the ruinous path it led the Overland towards. Increasing the industrial capacity of the nation without compromising the health and safety of its citizens would be a slow and deliberate process. There was no shortage of people looking for work once the gears of the economy began to churn like they used to.\nA difficulty encountered in the Kingdom's reindustrialization program was the rise of organized labor movements. Large groups of workers, many congregated in the former Overland territories of the North, have formed cliques and been less than cooperative in regard to the crown's production quotas.

The title of baron and the independence that came with it greatly increased the wealth and prosperity of the region, to the extent that the more influential barons conveniently forgot which crown they owed their title to.\nKeeping the more unruly barons in line would be a frequent headache for future regents, though no one could predict the extent of treachery they would sink to during the Great War. As a part of a gamble for outright secession, several barons conspired with the Overland to tear the Kingdom apart from within. These acts of treason were foiled, but the idea that the Acorns were “oppressing” the Baronies with their edicts was an old sentiment that would linger. Even when all that remained of the territories were scattered estates and ill-formed dreams of confederacy.\nNow that the Kingdom of Acorn is entering a new status quo, the remaining barons and their holdings will need to be carefully watched in order to prevent them from rebelling again."

Only half of the people who once lived there had returned, the rest having been lost as robians in the years that passed since. Immigrants from Northamer and Yurashia have made up for that number, fresh faces seeking new opportunities wherever they could be found.\nA red marsupial hopped in a vest hopped down the street and greeted the king with a bow.\n“G’day, yer majesty!” said Walt the Wallaby, leader of the Downunda Freedom Fighters. Behind him were the other members of his crew: Barby Koala, Wombat Stu, Guru Emu, and Bill Platypus. Each of them were brave, loyal soldiers; Max vaguely recalled the wombat fellow was a member of his secret service. “Enjoyin’ yer time in our neck of the woods?”\nKing Max nodded.\n“I trust the repairs to the city are going as per schedule?”\n“Ahead of schedule, sir! Why, I reckon the city will be right as rain by the end of the month!”\n“Excellent. I will leave the rest of the oversight to you, Walter. Keep up the good work.”\nThough the trip was brief, Maximilian Acorn was satisfied with his findings. The territory was not yet ready for war, but it could one day be a useful ally against the Eggman Empire."

There are bright individuals who could aid our efforts, but they can only do so much as civilians."\nMax frowned.

With the loss of the old king during Robotnik's reign of terror, the struggle of taking back the occupied Mercia was left to his young son, Robert.\nThere have been many trials and upheavals in the time since Mercia was founded. We have doubts that those troubles are over yet. King Robert, known to his loyal subjects as Rob O' the Hedge, is young and untested.

Many who survived long enough to regain their old bodies and minds found themselves displaced in other ways, no longer with a homeland to call their own. Those lost years saw the fall of ancient nations and the rise of new ones to replace them, the largest of which lied under the surface of Mobius for ages untold.\nThe old kingdoms of North Efrika collapsed into brutal civil war and were torn apart by internal strife. Aside from the Kingdom of Leonus, all that remained of them were footnotes in the history of the United Federation. The U.F. were a sprawling ring of city-states that stretched across multiple continents, the inhabitants consisting primarily of the Overlanders' genetic relatives: Humans. While they were content with staying hidden beneath their fortified mountain bunkers for much of recent history, the looming threat of Doctor Eggman made continued isolation all but impossible.\nIn spite of Max's trepidations about the country when it was first unveiled years ago, President Herbert Wilson proved to be a refreshingly reasonable individual. He has been a dedicated ally against the Eggman Empire, knowing full well that it will take the cooperation of multiple nations to keep that despotic madman in check. King Maximilian Acorn was assured by Wilson that, in spite of the upcoming elections and the possibility of a new leader entering office, there should be no change in their alliance.\nWas that a fact, or merely wishful thinking? The fault of allying with a democracy was that "yes" today could become "no" tomorrow, as one leader with a strict set of principles would eventually be replaced with another that had very different priorities from their predecessor."

There was cause for much rejoicing in the land, both from the people who were glad to see Maximilian the Cursed retire and those who looked forward to how the young regent would set their nation straight.\nNot all in the country saw this as a change for the better. Nobody in the right mind thought it was a good idea for Max to sit on the throne a day longer, but Elias Acorn was only barely of age to inherit his father's crown. The Acorn monarchy was an ancient institution, burdened by the mistakes of rulers both past and present. Elias was by all accounts a man of good nature, but who would hold the latest Acorn accountable if the burden of absolute power transformed him into a very different person?\nOn that day, several influential people saw the favor of Prince Elias over the much more seasoned Princess Sally as the last straw. From the growing workers' unions of the Titanium Belt to the rising populist movements in the Baronies, the idea that Prince Elias will not be the man to save the country dug in and quickly gained traction.\nThere would be no greater source of revolutionary fervor than that which was brewing in the heart of New Mobotropolis itself. The Prowers knew that Elias Acorn did not have what it took to lead the kingdom on his own. This time, they would not be silenced.

Little was known about the new king, save that he was thought lost during the Great War and returned from obscurity only recently. He was at a disadvantage in convincing the kingdom that his father didn't choose him solely because Sally refused to marry.\nThe new king took this opportunity to clear up some mysteries surrounding his background. Elias spent most of his developmental years on a royal compound atop the Floating Island, raised by a colonel and his wife until he was found by the Secret Service. King Max was overjoyed to have his son return home, but the young Prince was not yet ready to take power. He enjoyed the quiet life of a woodcutter in the Feral Forest with his new wife Meg and step-daughter Alexis until King Max determined the time had come for him to step down.\nThis openness won him some followers, but King Elias was a long way from stabilizing a country at the precipice of crisis.\n"

He was even rumored to have met with the leaders of these unions in private, to better assure them that his intentions were noble. That might not be enough to convince diehard unionists like Billy Wrench to give up on his dreams of “One Big Union” for Northamer, but it may have caused the more tepid socialist agitators to simmer down."

Rotor Walrus, one of the Knothole Freedom Fighters’ chief machinists, was collaborating with royal guards to root out the unionists and undo any damage from sabotage that was caused by radical elements in the labor force.\nFor all of the diverse members in their ranks, this has not sat well with the unions in the slightest.

The nation born from within imperialist wars celebrates it's freedom, but for how long? \n\nAvisla was one of the first colonies of Pirenian Empire, founded in 2543 and believed to become a base for further colonial expansion. This land is populated by idle tropical birds. It became a favorite place of kings from all over the world. Many trade ships used to stop here to bring several barrels of rum so crews could continue traveling with all sails. Moreover, cheap labor of locals produced a lot of ore and sugar cane for the empire. With piracy spreading in 27 century and escalation of colonial conflicts, Avisla had become a large naval base so massive fleets could stand in local ports. Markets of slaves and armament were developing on this achipelago.\n\nHowever, Pirenian kings' dreams weren't destined to be justified: during the Foolish War of 2710-2718, Overlanders seized the island, and after the Juana Treaty of 2719, Avisla became an Overlander protactorate. The exploitation of locals came much worse then - tropical birds never expected Overlanders to make their lives better than under the boot of Pirenian Empire, and they were punished for their resistance to Overlander troops by massive enslavement and terror for local peasants. This policy resulted in revolts and wars several times, and after the Six Years' War of 2910-2916 the colonial rule of Overlanders had changed. Though Overlanders supressed the rebels, they understood that they could either wipe out the entire Avislan population or give it some freedoms. And they found the compromise: the First aristocratic Republic of Avisla was found. This puppet state was still a cheap supplier of raw materials, but it's existence calmed nationalist sentiments of Avislan people for several centuries.\n\nDuring the Great War 3215-3225, Overlander Empire occupied Avisla again, dissolving the republic and enforcing conscription of locals so they could fill the frontline gaps after severe defeats of 3223. But this desperate measure resulted in another revolt, and the Overlander garrison was soon destroyed by Eco Revolucionario Movement led by José Balaclaro. Unfortunately, the Second Avislan Republic could not last long: in 3226 Robotnik forces attacked the island. Comandante Balaclaro was roboticized and forced to pursue Robotnik's tyrannical policies. That was a time of the highest upturn of guerrilla spirit. Avislan Freedom Fighters waged guerrilla war against their former idealogical leader, and after a brave group of 64 exiled revolutionaries led by comandante Rafael Fusilos had returned from Rethenia, combined forces of Revolutionary Military Council (Consejo Militar Revolucionario) overthrew Robotnik regime and destroyed Balaclaro's robotic body unable to save him. \n\nKatzerist wing of CMR is the most influental and active now, but it's authority is not consolidated yet..."

Before you enter our glorious century, let us start with a brief history.\n\nWhen Mobius burst into flames of the Great War, scientific progress opened a new page in the history of the planet. \n\nJulian Kintobor, a great scientist of his time, was a soldier on the scientific front on both sides of the war. Rejected by the ungrateful Overlanders, Dr. Kintobor found his place in the service of His Majesty King Maximilian Acorn. Since then, his military genius has been sent to help the Mobians in their war against the Overlanders. The perfect weaponry created by Julian Kintobor with the help of his faithful nephew Colin Kintobor turned the war and helped the Mobians defeat the Overlanders. Thanks to the Great War, Robotnik was elevated to the rank of Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Army. It was the peak of his power, but King Max got in the way of his aspirations. \n\nYears of war have opened Kintobor' s eyes to the blindness of both Mobians and Overlanders. Their so-called "will" is no more than a set of instincts, and to prevent chaos and destruction, it took a firm hand of such a genius as Kintobor was. After King Max decided to disband the War Ministry, Julian Kintobor realized that there would be no better time to take power. He secretly built an army of robots and on the night between 297 days and 298 days in 3225 he captured Mobotropolis and overthrew the Acorns, sending the king to the Zone of Silence. Alas, Queen Alicia and her little son Elias had managed to flee to Angel Island. Princess Sally also escaped, and was destined to lead the Knothole Freedom Fighters. \n\nSir Charles's invention was in the right hands. The newly proclaimed Emperor Ivo the Robotnik used the Robot to turn disobedient Mobians into obedient robot Robians, deprived of the so-called "will" and following the orders of the Robotnik himself. Of course, like the wild beasts they are, Mobians began to resist. Robotnik's army captured almost all of Mobius, and everywhere began a ruthless war with "Freedom Fighters" groups - rebel groups that undermined the infrastructure of the Robotnik Empire. The most powerful Freedom Fighters group, led by Princess Sally Acorn and Sonic the Hedgehog, operated in the village of Knothole."

    egg.12.t:0 "The Eggman Empire - part 2"
    egg.12.d:0 "The war that Robotnik went to, lasted a long 10 years. It went down in history as the First Robotnik War. It took far more lives than the Great War. The fate of millions of Mobians was unenviable - complete Roboticization and loss of independent consciousness. Jules the Hedgehog, seriously wounded during the Great War, was the first Robian, but it was a big mistake to leave his child alive. Sonic became a big problem for the Empire, like all other Freedom Fighters. These groups appeared in every corner of Mobius, on the land, in the sky and in the sea.\n\nGradually losing control of the periphery, where local warlords could not cope with the growing resistance of the people, Robotnik also experienced great difficulties in the heart of his Empire. To fight against Knothole Freedom Fighters, Robotnik had to divert significant forces from the outskirts of the Empire, which ironically contributed to the fall of his rule. To end the main threat to his rule, Robotnik implemented one of his old projects - the Ultimate Annihilator. Its use in Operation Endgame was to put an end to all resistance, but the betrayal of Colin Kintobor, known as Snively, led to the wrong triggering of the weapon of retribution - the Robotnik was destroyed instead of Knothole.\n\nIn 3235, the war was over. Although Snively tried to hold on to the rest of the Empire, his power did not last long. Shortly after his uncle's death, he was captured by the Freedom Fighters trying to escape from Robotropolis. The lands devastated by Robotnik were thrown into the abyss of anarchy. The vast expanses of Mobius were uninhabitable, and the wastelands of West Northamer could not be reclaimed even after the fall of Robotropolis.\n\nSnively was able to escape from captivity months later, but fate brought him to the space station of the so-called Robo-Robotnik - as it turned out, it was Robotnik from an alternative reality, who arrived at Mobius Prime to continue his path of conquest. He knew about Snively's betrayal, but gave him one last chance to redeem himself. From the ashes of the Robotnik Empire rose the Eggman Empire - Robotnik assumed the organic body and became known by this very name. The Eggman Empire continued the cause of its predecessor.\n\nThe new year of 3236 meets the Eggman Empire with great difficulties. The successful offensive deep into the Kingdom of Acorn by the actions of Sonic and other freedom fighters turned into a major retreat from all positions. Diversion groups, supervised from Knothole and New Mobotropolis, flooded the lands of the Egman Empire. Eggman's actions in trying to stop the resistance and regain control over the defective Robians only create more problems, and it is not known if the Empire will survive this year..."

    egg.2.d:0 "Metal Sonic was believed to be a masterpiece of Eggman's robotics. Dr. Robotnik had high hopes for Metal Sonic and was proud that this robot could fight Sonic on equal terms. But who knew what his experiments with artificial intelligence could lead to this time? \n\nThe peculiarity of Metal Sonic was his ability to scan the vital activity data of his opponents and copy their techniques and even superpowers. But beyond his abilities, Metal Sonic absorbed the thinking of every life form he scanned. Although the basis of his personality was Sonic's own data, the character of this machine was greatly distorted by the impressions of many of the leaders he met. Having the ability to move around Mobius, Metal Sonic faced different personalities, politicians, generals, dictators. Impressed by the horrors of war against the obnoxious Mobius, all these characters mixed with Sonic's vanity and created an uncontrollable monster... \n\nOne day, Metal Sonic revealed his true nature, just as Eggman began to suspect him of disloyalty. If the war had unfolded more successfully for Eggman, he could have kept control over his loyal warrior. But it was too late. Metal Sonic came to the conclusion that his own creator was an obstacle to his personal goals. With these thoughts, the robot broke into Eggman's command center, smashed his guards and captured the scientist himself. Metal Sonic did not dare destroy him, only because the doctor had valuable information with him, but he could not trust his creator anymore. That's why Metal Sonic locked Egman in a cryo chamber, freezing him and taking control of the Empire. Metal Sonic rebuilt himself from all the data he had scanned, taking the form of Neo Metal Sonic. Now that the Empire has a new ruler, Mobius and all life on the planet are under threat again..."

The general failure of the Eggman Empire on the fronts of the war with the Freedom Accord aggravated the moral crisis of the main person in the Empire.\n\n"Gaaaaaaaaarghhhhhhh! I hate that hedgehog!" - exclaimed Eggman, falling to the floor in front of his worst enemy's feet. Looking at Eggman's convulsions, Sonic himself felt guilty. Snively, who came to the aid of his uncle, did not interfere with the Freedom Fighters. He went up to Eggman and and patted his shoulder.\n\n"You didn't beat him this time, Sonic. You BROKE him. Eccentrics aside, he really is a genius... The world fell to his brilliance in a few short years." - He said it grievously. - "And then there's you. All the building, calculating, and planning in the world couldn't beat you. It's been gnawing at his mind for over a decade now... He simply could not take one more defeat at your hands."\n\nWith those words, Snively took Dr. Eggman. Neither Sonic nor Sally Acorn dared to capture a mad and broken scientist. Eggman's further fate has not yet been decided, but it was quite obvious that Snively would be in charge of all processes in the Empire in the nearest future."

    rcr.1.d:0 "Until the 3210 year Rethenia was just a simple colony of the Kingdom of Acorns. Formation of the capitalism in Mobian world were met by national-liberationist bourgeois revolutions all around the globe of Mobius. Rethenia became one of the 3210 year "Summer of nations" pioneers. The new Rethenian government pursued the interests of the bourgeoisie by expeling the old aristocracy. Yet Rethenia was not destined to achieve prosperity, because after 5 years the Great War started - the bloodiest armed conflict until that time, in which Rethenia intervened on the side of the Mobian powers in order to reunite with the fraternal people of Cherniwschina and to control the lands of Soleanna. Brutal war almost bleeded the country, but due to overall success of all other allied counties Rethenia has managed to establish itself in Cherniwschina, including this country into Rethenia. But in the year 3225, the year of the Great war's end, the thunder of Robotnik's Empire roared, appearing as the result of the coup of Julian Kintobor. Rethenian republic tried to confront the Empire, by using an army weakened from the previous war, but its efforts were in vain. In 3228 Stalegor and many other cities were captured by Robotnik and Rethenia capitulated. Only the people, who experienced the horrors of forced robotization, did not give up. In the movement of Rethenian Freedom Fighters converged both right and left-wing forces of the country. The Red Guard of the Freedom Fighters distinguished itself by attacking cities and destroying Robotnik’s proteges, undermining railways and robot factories. During the First Robotnik War, 2 political forces formed: the nationalist RNRP and the socialist RPRA. After Robotnik was expelled from the lands of Rethenia in 3229, the restoration period began. Yet the Coalition government could not solve a single important issue in the face of hunger, huge debts to the United Federation and desolation of agricultural land. \n\nThis led to radicalization of society and the collapse of the coalition. During a strike at the "Arsenal" arms factory, a conflict occurred between the hero of the First Robotnik War, Yuri Pallasov, who headed the avant-garde wing of the RPRA, and General Boris Martynov. This conflict was the starting point for the armed uprising of the proletariat of central Rethenia and the civil war, which took 2 and a half years and cost millions of victims. During the civil war, Chernivshchina, Svetlales, Latgale and Tuunimia declared independence, and the newly formed Rethenian Council Socialist Republic was forced to recognize them due to a lack of forces to control the western borders. The Red Army of Rethenia, created by Pallasov and Leona Eismesser, was able to defeat the Supreme Reactionary Forces in 3233, and after the explosion of a cobalt bomb over the last Martynov fortress, the VRS forces surrendered, and Martynov died. Rethenian Council Socialist Republic now stands in the way of implementation of scientific communism principles by Heinrich Katzer, and the prosperity of this country will depend entirely on the efforts of the working class of Rethenia and on the victories of the International, which included Avisla, Hiboulia and Transashia."

Фильм является нескрываемой насмешкой над царящим во многих странах культом Соника, о чем говорит весьма карикатурная внешность Мистера Спидстера - главного героя этой картины. Сюжет фильма строится вокруг приключений Мистера Спидстера, по воле случая попавшего в Сталегор - столицу Ретении. Синий ёж пугает прохожих, убегает от сотрудников КОРТСа и занимается вредительством в сторону социалистичсекой собственности, пока не оказывается пойман одиноким оперативником КОРТС. Но фильм старается быть немного жизнеутверждающим, и поэтому главный герой не только становится другом чекиста, но и осознает ошибочность своих жизненных приоритетов. В конце фильма Мистер Спидстер становится Товарищем Быстроходовым и побеждает доктора Механизмова в неравной схватке при поддержке своих новых друзей и бригады пролетариев. \n\nФильм получил неоднозначные оценки в обществе. Мало кто из граждан страны Советов может оспорить идею этого фильма, но всех, особенно детей, напугала графическая составляющая и облик главного героя. Через неделю после начала проката фильма зафиксировано 148 обращений в психиатрические больницы, в каждом из которых были заметны последствия просмотра этого фильма.

В центре заговора, по данным председателя КОРТСа Николая Колючкина, стоит Геннадий Шилов - командир 2 армии, штаб которой размещается под Сталегором. Помимо Шилова, в заговоре задействованы 24 офицера, ученых и даже партийных деятелей. В условиях накаляющеся политической обстановки в ожидании VII Съезда Советов возможный путч может стать искрой, которая может уничтожить страну Советов в пожаре новой гражданской войны, и допускать подобное не в интересах рабочего класса Мобиуса. \n\nКорни конфликта уходят еще во времена Гражданской Войны, которая закончилась 3 года назад. Шилов тогда возглавлял милитаристскую оппозицию, которая была недовольна "злоупотреблениями" декретом о национальном самоопределении бывших национальных окраин Ретенской Республики. Так же Шилов выражал возмущение тем, что мы до сих пор пускаем на смерть живых мобинцев, когда, по недавнему открытию его сподвижника, - профессора Павла Угрюмова, - возможно было роботизировать павших бойцов и отправить их первыми эшелонами. А в целом, Шилов регулярно обвинял и продолжает обвинять наше руководство в мягкотелости по отношению к возможным внешним врагам. \n\nКолючкин предлагает для обеспечения безопасности немедленно арестовать всех задействованных в заговоре и всех заподозренных. Очевидно, что агрессивные меры могут послужить толчком к началу масштабных чисток в Красной Армии, что может ослабить её командование. Но во имя безопасности РССР на такие меры можно пойти.

    rcr.30.d:0 "The end of the Civil War in Rethenia did not at all signify the end of the revolution, as is commonly believed in many intellectual circles of society. The triumph of the forces of the Revolution over internal reaction only opened a new page in the history of class war, when Rethenian proletariat can decide where should he go further along the road to the victory of socialism. Society is opened to the unpaved field of new solutions and ideas, and any independant party activist had his vision, and the end of the civil war only incited the factional element in the ranks of the party that were forming during the war. \n\nThe first intra-party conflict, which put the ruling RPRA on the brink of a split, was outlined in connection with the outcome of the Hussar conference on March 27, 3231. Conference on which attended delegations from Cherniwshchyna, Svetlales, Latygalia, Tuunimia as well as Council Rethenian ones, ended with the recognition of the independence for all of the fragments of the old Rethenian Republic. Even though Pallasov prevailed in the internal party debate, for the first time he experienced resistance from the Krugin-Zimov-Apelsinov's group, which later will be named "Nacional-Kattseristskaya frakcija RPRA". Krugin supporters declared that they will not stand sacrifice of national interests in the name of momentary whim. \n\nThe more weakly the threat of the Gray Army seemed, the more cruel the dictates of the vangurad party seemed. Against the backdrop of the Sinitsyn unrest in May 3233, the Khnykin-Lisitsin-Borotbytko group issued a “letter of seventeen” in which they demanded a relaxation of pressure on both the rural population and workers, as well as criticized the vanguardist artists for violating the principles of workers' democracy. This was one of the reasons for easing the RPRA policy for the next three years. Approximately at the same time, feuds reached the ranks of the Red Army, when Shilov and his comrades from the "fifth division" started a discussion about the urgent need for reform in the army and the continuation of the war with the capitalist countries. Shilov’s defeat in the discussion provoked him to conduct activities in secret from the People’s Commissariat of Defense. \n\nAt the VI Congress of Soviets, which is also known as the "first post-war Congress", the majority was won by the vanguardist faction, but this victory was overshadowed by the sudden elimination from the political life of the elected chairman Pallasov due to the exacerbation of the "magnetic syndrome" - a side effect of the excessive use of magnetic abilities of his body, superimposed on nervous exhaustion during the years of the First War of Robotnik and the Civil War, chained Pallasov to a hospital bed. The Vozhd of the Revolution spent half a year in the hospital, while in his absence and under the conditions of the decayed state security services, internal party discussions, rampant bureaucratization and stagnation of the economy, were formed prerequisites for the final split of the RPWV. On his 33rd birthday on December 28, 3235, Yuri Pallasov returned from the sanatorium, and now he gazes upon the chaos in the party. Will he be able to restore order, or even the intervention of the Vozhd of the Revolution will not be able to save the situation?"

Даже такие известные враги авангардистов, как Николай Хныкин, выступили с протестом против политизированного суда, итог которого был очевиден еще до начала заседания. Но какое дело Шилову, красному офицеру и спасителю Революции, до мнения кабинентных экономистов, строящих интриги в профсоюзах? \n\nК полудню, во время выступления Геннадия Шилова со свидетельствами причастности товарища Шубина к убийству Палласова якобы по заказу Айсмессер, председательствующий суда Владислав Андреев упал без сознания. Пользуясь отвлеченностью Военной коллегии внезапным происшествием, в ходе которого Андреев скончался от смертельного отравления, в зал суда ворвались оперативники КОРТС, застав врасплох и разоружив охрану. Выстрелами в потолок чекисты заставили лечь лицом в пол практически всех присутствующих, а стоять остался лишь Шилов. Он же увидел, как прямо перед его глазами через распахнутые двери входит Николай Колючкин, председатель КОРТСа. Товарищ Колючкин требует прекратить это "позорное заседание", но Шилов попытался оказать сопротивление, выхватив свой пистолет. За это он был застрелен Колючкиным на месте. \n\nДраматическая разязка в зале суда сопровождалась массированными облавами в разных городах РССР, в ходе которых арестовывались и увозились якобы на допрос многие партийные деятели. В течение следующих 24 часов многие из них были расстреляны, а профессор Угрюмов, известный как верный сторонник Шилова, был повешен в Сталегоре. Подавленное после часов пыток шиловцами Айсмессер не позволило ей оказать какое-либо сопротивление, а Шубин, как личный друг Колючкина, отказался противиться его приказаниям. Утром 23 марта Колючкин официально вступил в должность председателя ЦК РПРА, а затем и в должность председателя Совнаркома. Оправдывая захват власти, он предал общественности комропмат на Шилова, как настоящего виновника убийства Палласова. Теперь, когда Колючкин сконцентрировал в своих руках всю полноту государственной власти, он намерен "отомстить всем реакционерам, стоявшим за контрреволюционными бандами Шилова".

В первый же день 500 делегатов наполнили зал заседаний, а Учредительная Комиссия Съезда Советов торжественно объявила о начале выборов. Перед началом голосования каждый кандидат представил делегатам программу своей фракции. Лидирующая фракция будет предопределять законодательные акты, выносить внешнеполитические решения, определять вектор государственного планирования и иметь преимущество в осуществлении других функций. \nПервым выступил товарищ Палласов, нынешний председатель Совнаркома и член ЦК РПРА. Юрий Александрович обещал не только сохранение принципов катцеризма, но и будущее продолжение социалистического строительства на базе форсированных автоматизации, роботизации и коммунализации всей экономики. Кроме того, товарищ Палласов гарантировал, что РССР не даст угаснуть пламени Мировой Революции и приведет рабочих всего Мобиуса к победе над капиталистами. Культурная революция, уничтожающая старый быт и создающая нового, готового к коммунизму мобианца.\nСледующим выступил эпатажный товарищ Кругин, призвавший обратиться к историческому прошлому Ретении в деле строительства социализма на основе национальной культуры. Не отменяя лидирующей роли плана в народном хозяйстве и настаивая на форсированном развитии производства, Кругин настаивал на сохранении традиционных ценностей. В его планах - превращение Советской Ретении в сверхдержаву, объединившую Юрашию под своим знаменем. \nНаконец, место на трибуне занял товарищ Хныкин. Он убеждал делегатов в том, что социализм - это прежде всего борьба за освобождение личности, а социалистические преобразования произойдут через мирную интеграцию мелкой буржуазии в социалистическое общество. В приоритетах - пацифистская внешняя политика, строительство синдикалистской экономики, развитие личных прав и прав меньшинств. \nНачинается борьба, в которой победителем может быть только один...

И сегодня товарищ Палласов на очередном пленуме ЦК РПРА выступил с очередным заявлением, в котором он обрушился с критикой на партийный "дресс-код". В конце своего обращения он объявил одежду пережитком классового общества, которому не место в социалистическом будущем. Кроме того, он отметил, что необходимость в ношении одежды очень скоро отмирает в связи с развитием производительных сил общества. Наконец, Палласов напомнил, что многие мобианские мужчины и женщины уже не носят одежды, не страдая ни от общественного порицания, ни от холода. \n\nСерьезность намерений товарища Палласова поняли, когда он на глазах у товарищей сорвал с себя френч и выкинул всю одежду в окно. Партийцы были вынуждены воспринимать это серьезно из-за присутствоваших в зале лояльных вождю солдат. С его приказов по всей стране прошли демонстрации против ношения одежды, когда та признавалась буржуазным пережитком и унылым декадентством.

The Union of Socialist Robotics offered its assistance in organizing industrial, agricultural, and domestic robot halls, while a group of 16 nuclear physicists insisted on demonstrating the importance of nuclear power for the national economy. Finally, the chairman of the Academy of Sciences of the RCSR Viktor Gromov took the public initiative to expand the exhibition to industrial and scientific topics. \n\nTheir requests were satisfied, and the project of the exhibition was named "The Exhibition of the Achievements of Rethenian Workers" (VDRT).

The opening ceremony was attended by Chairman Pallasov himself, Comrade Eismesser, Comrade Shubin and Academician Gromov, and delegations from Avisla, Transashia and Hiboulia were invited. Representatives of Transashia opened the first restaurant in Rethenia, where the cuisine of Transasia nations is served, and the Hiboulians laid the rocket and space pavilion.

The agenda of the Congress will include economic and cultural issues, as well as issues of further organization of the party. In view of the apparent defeat of the opposition, no one in the party had no doubt that the decisions of the next Congress will be partly or entirely meet the program of the Vanguardist wing of the party. The plenary also decided to withdraw the opposition from the Central Committee, but a decision on the fate of opposition factions will be taken at the party congress."

He answered with a short indifferent voice as if he was receiving an ordinary colleague: \n\n”Let her in.” \n\nThe lioness entered the office, greeted by the peaceful look of the Chairman. She put a large pile of papers on the table, sitting in a chair sideways to Pallasov. The Pallas's cat took these papers and took a look at the contents. On the front page there was an inscription "Report from the meeting of the VSNKh of 8.09.3236". Not eager to read the entire thirty-page report from beginning to end, Pallasov put off the papers and paid attention to the Eismesser, when she spoke intently. \n\n“The Supreme Board of National Economy is not satisfied with the state of the light and food industry. In addition to the obsolescence of equipment and low productivity, there is a low quality of products. Comrade Molodykh said that even the stray animals do not eat our sausages!”\n\n“Shit, and not sausage”, he agreed, snorting. \n\n”Well, I had almost poisoned myself with yesterday's yogurt. At the plenary session, even representatives of the People's Commissariat of Health reported on outbreaks of intestinal and vascular diseases in Stalegor. The Supreme Board of National Economy believes that it is time to introduce national standards,” she replied. \n\nComrade Pallasov listened to her with his hands crossed. So, the introduction of standards is costly, but at the same time useful: developed standards of food production can improve the health of the nation; in other industries, standardized production will be capable of organizing the transition to military production if necessary."

    rcr.48.d:0 "The policy of forced communalization did not meet the acceptance of the rural population of our vast country. The landowners, who were lucky enough to preserve the land, incited poor peasants to sabotage the process of communalization, frightening them with stories about the imminent starvation which our commissars bring. In addition, several local party organizations continue to oppose the new policy, complaining about land acquisition in favor of cooperative and state farms. \n\nIn response to all accusations, to slander towards the communalization campaign, Comrade Pallasov decided to address these poor peasants with a new slogan: "You won't perish with us!" With this slogan he concluded his speech at the next plenary session of VSNKh, and later he went on a three-week tour of villages in southern Rethenia, conducting inspections and bringing his slogan to the poor peasants. \n\n"The peasants of Rethenia, who had been shattered by three wars, could only come out of the abyss of hunger and violence by uniting their efforts. - said the chairman at the rally. - We can achieve much more in alliance with our industry." \n\nThe apogee of the campaign was the arrival of thousands of engineers and workers to help organize new agriculture. This group of specialists was nicknamed "mechanists" by the people. Mechanists organized communes, trained peasants to work with advanced equipment and demonstrated its work in practice. Party activists demonstrated the unity of the people and the party to the peasant masses, and the ravaged peasants, seeing the communalization as a prospect of victory over poverty and landlessness, were much less afraid to join the communes. The slogan "You won't perish with us", addressed to the peasants, became a beautiful expression, but it symbolized not just a cry to the poor man - it symbolized the cause. The working class in Rethenia did not leave the peasantry in trouble."

A peasant - he works, yes, but he works mainly for his own wealth. The new peasants, who are afraid of poverty and hunger, flooded the lands that were deserted after the expulsion of Robotnik. We supported their desire to preserve their land in the civil war, but now the interests of the peasants run counter to the idea of rebuilding our country and creating a socialist economy. A small and ruined peasant wants more of his land, but a firmer peasant does not want to give it to society. \n\nThe RPRA sees only one way to resolve these contradictions. A revolution in all agriculture is necessary. Private farms must be expropriated, enlarged, and turned into highly productive enterprises with an industrial labor organization and an urban welfare system. By the easy thought of theorists and teleologists, this policy was called "communalization". \n\nVladimir Shchukin, 68 years old rooster, was awakened by a phone call. The frightened elderly man with a quick step of his limping legs reached the other end of his modest village house with a tilted porch. \n\n"Good mo'ning, and wat do ya need?" - grandpa Vovka asked, scared a bit. Someone from a local party organization called, and he called the only villager capable of typing. \n\n"Comrade Shchukin, I need your help in updating the land cadastre," the secretary of the party cell replied. It sounded suspicious enough, but the work required a quick report. Life in the village of Sosnovki would change forever on that day, as it did in tens of thousands of other villages in the country of Soviets."

The offensive of the Vanguardist faction continued, and no one could stop it. The speeches of the Pallasov’s opponent with the party became louder and more desperate. One after the other, members of the opposition spoke. Nationalists and autonomists now acted as if they were looking for the way to victory over the common enemy in the alliance. \n\nPallasov listened to the factionists' speeches with a mood like a wild cat, who was about to bring its clawed paw over a rat. Comrade Eismesser, who sat to the left of the Chairman, gave exactly this comparison. She wrote that Pallasov was ready to gobble everyone who somehow tried to influence the party line at one glance. He perceived the party line as something inviolable for the elements hostile to Katzerism. All that could keep him from aggression was to go to Comrade Shubin's address. \n\n"Comrades, - Shubin began his appeal, rising above all as the highest member of the Central Committee, which had an unfazed calm, - workers of Shilovograd Electrotechnical Plant write me letters. I, as a worker, cannot leave my brothers' voices unheard. \n\nThe Hero of the Civil War brought to the Central Committee the collective complaints of workers against the workers' control bodies. The actual sabotage of production came from both the factory management and the corrupt members of the workers' inspection. The whole story came down to a disappointing but important requirement: it was necessary to put an end to both the bureaucratic arbitrariness in the field and the anarchy of government in the state. \n\nAfter that, the word was given to Comrade Pallasov. He criticized the factionists, accusing them that one part of the opposition aspired to anarchy in governance, the other to bureaucratization of the party and state. \n\n"In this regard, I propose to put to a vote a resolution.” - the Chairman concluded on this. This resolution was adopted by voting - the party, the working control bodies, and the governing bodies of Soviets were subject to reorganization. Rabkrin's powers were expanded, the factions lost the right to present their program, and the principle of work of state institutions was brought in conformity with the principles of democratic centralism.""

Much more deplorable situation is observed in regional centers, towns, and villages of smaller size. Many villages are surviving by subsistence farming, unable to purchase food and necessities at their own expense. Representatives of the Far Eastern Railway tried to convince us with their notes that the loss of goods associated with technical difficulties, delays, accidents, congestion of the railway system. \n\n"Serpovets A700" car, the official price - seventy thousand tselkovys. Comrade Shpalin has refined tastes in cars". - Nikolay Koliuchkin noted with irony, looking through the documents on the table in front of Comrade Pallasov. The clock was ticking, and the Pallas’s cat continued to think with a gloomy face how such personalities could find themselves in strategically important organs. \n\n"If this is a hint to detain and estimate the value of his property, I give you the green light. The main thing is for you to be sure that it is necessary, Comrade Koliuchkin," concluded the chairman, stirring sugar in a cup of caramel tea. - "Probably, he also knows better about tea than I do". \n\nThe inspection of Shpalin's apartment and the inventory of his property did not even take an hour, and already so much information was opened that it was enough for more than one volume of materials. A whole corrupt network opened up, in which more than a hundred people were involved, but hacked correspondence indicates that 22 executives responsible for the movement of freight trains, organized theft and sale of goods through intermediaries, whose names were also quickly identified. All involved persons were arrested and taken to Stalegor for a show trial. Comrade Pallasov, who was present at the trial, remained cool until he was given his word. \n\n"Comrades, such criminal acts are symptoms of the disease that hit our state machine. This case should initiate real personnel purges and serve all other lessons that the Council authorities do not tolerate careerism and bureaucratic arbitrariness.

Many scientists were forced to flee the capital, scattering around the country, and the flames of civil war forced them to leave the country altogether. Some have been roboticized, and their fate is now unknown. Some of the scientists who collaborated with Robotnik either fled to the Empire or met their punishment in front of firing squads. Hardly half of the former faculty managed to recover, not to mention the destruction of infrastructure and academic buildings of the university itself. \n\nRebuilding and renovation of the University were an initiative of academician Gromov, supported by comrade Eismesser. Invitations were sent out to outstanding Rethenian specialists abroad, with appeals to return home and help the development of national science. To smooth out the fear of possible purges motivated by memories of the Civil War; the letter provided a sharp critical analysis of the former policy of the Academy of Sciences of the RCSR. This letter was signed by 112 professors and academicians, including Viktor Gromov himself. \n\nThe letter was publicly shown. It had an effect rather quickly, and many luminaries of science began to return. The completion of the restoration and opening of 6 new educational buildings was a national holiday. \n\n"Comrades, on behalf of the Council of People's Commissars and the RKP Politburo, I thank all those present, thank all those who have contributed to the birth of new science,” Comrade Pallasov made a speech at the meeting on the opening of the University buildings. \n\n"And I want to thank the party that until this day at least some of my colleagues have survived,” in a joking manner, Gromov started, causing laughter and applause. - “In front of us lies an unpaved land, you might say, covered with the dust of oblivion. We have lost so many years, surviving in a whirlwind of turmoil. But I assure you that I am ready to do everything to make up for the development of national science, not only to catch up with what has been lost, but also to break out ahead. I urge my colleagues to unite around this task.” \n\nThe foundation of The Research Institute of Applied Nuclear Physics at Stalegor University became a highlight of the program. The official part of the event included lectures by the Institute's leadership, as well as by some professors. \n\n"We have met the deadline, Comrade Chairman,” the nuclear physicist said, following Pallasov and the government delegation to the underground levels of the Institute. Only Pallasov and some other persons knew what was waiting for them and one could understand the indescribable surprise of the others when they were shown a nuclear reactor operating at full capacity, put into operation and launched only a couple of days ago..."

With all due respect to Comrade Pallasov, military studies and participation in party affairs are badly combined ...". \n\n"Didn't you say that wit and discipline are what makes our soldier invincible? We have discipline in our party”, - objected Akim, the commander of the guard unit. - "A party soldier must cope no worse than an ordinary villager.” \n\n"But the party wants to make them first-class warriors, let us say, "knights of the revolution”. This sounds ridiculous, and in my opinion, it sounds like a propaganda task, nothing more. I am a professional, not a propagandist. Anyway, I, who wholeheartedly supports our military science, agree to supervise your program. I will teach you everything that I can or cannot do myself,” Kunduzov summed. Akim's eyes sparkled with joy, the feeling that the Robian officer could not experience himself. \n\nSome time later, drills at the training ground near Yozhingrad showed what party recruits are capable of. Many of them had already been involved in the civil war and knew the basics of tactical training. Veteran soldiers patronized the very new recruits at the orders of Kunduzov, which strengthened the spirit of brotherhood and responsibility in the troops. Studying the military science carefully, the soldiers perfectly fulfilled the standards, and to the final exercises they successfully completed all the training tasks, capturing the enemy's headquarters and with the help of captured opponents’ weapons destroyed the tank fleet and the airfield. Comrade Shubin, who was present at the exercise, highly appreciated the combat training, and at the final ceremony he personally presented awards to all the outstanding ones. Shelepenko and Kunduzov were awarded medals "For Excellence in Training”. The exercise was broadcasted nationwide, accompanied by popular electronic music and impressive special effects. Most of all TV viewers remembered the happy faces of the "communards" who completed the training camp, who did not hesitate to embrace each other as brothers right after the combat episode. The show performed by the party figures showed all residents of our country that the possibilities of Mobians are limitless, and the Red Army can help them realize their best qualities, at the same time glorifying them."

Viktor Gromov was stroking the feathers on his head, amazed that he was on his way to his third plenary session of the day. This day he realized that he should have been afraid of his desires after all. He told Pallasov a lot about the prospects of cybernetics, managed to get Eismesser interested in the questions of artificial intelligence. And when it was time to get down to the real project in practice, even this cold-hearted genius was seized with excitement. He was not an economist, but he was to be at the helm of the most ambitious economic project in Rethenian history. Fantasy, nonsense, utopia - numerous people at home and abroad lashed out with criticism at the new project to automate the economy, which was compared to Robotnik's plans in scale and depth of impact. Would Council Rethenia succeed in crossing a new frontier in planning, overcoming the former anarchy of production? \n\nThe crow didn't notice how he almost bumped into a stately male hare. He stumbled back and almost bowed to the academic, addressing him with a tone full of anticipation: \n\n"Victor Georgievich, greetings! I was assigned to your institute just today...", began the hare, shyly lowering his voice. \n\n"Sent to me? Alright, but would you mind introducing yourself?", the raven immediately countered with a condescending tone, adjusting his pince-nez. \n\n"I'm Khariton Ionovich Dryadovich, Doctor of Physics and Mathematics, but right now I'm more of an economist." \n\n"So it was you who won the Hiboulian Prize in Economics a month ago, right? So you're supposed to be at the plenary session, which is the other way around," Viktor said in the end, puzzled, pointing in the other direction. The hare was not yet oriented in the premises of the Institute, but soon the colleagues had quickly taken the right course. Professor Dryadovich's appearence lifted Gromov's spirits: he had no doubt that with such a person they would be able to accomplish a lot, because Dryadovich himself was famous for his methods of solving the most complex economic and mathematical optimization problems. The plan to create an electronic system for socialist economic planning seemed absolutely serious, but it didn't bother the academic anymore, because he understood that the best minds in Soviet Retenia would certainly be on his side."

So we waited until one of them slipped up, we captured him and I...presuaded him to tell us where they were hiding. Within a week they had all been rounded up. Most were sent here but the rest were removed. I will say the executions took longer than I would have expected.” \n\nKoliuchkin nodded, “I’ve faced the same issue. If you want to save on bullets here’s a tip. Tie two of them together, shoot one and knock the body into the river. The other will be dragged under and drown.” \n\nShe nodded, “I’d never thought of that. Normally I just line them up and use one bullet.” \n\n“Not a bad idea, but there’s no guarantee that the bullet will go through multiple bodies.” \n\nIlsa gave an agreeable shrug, “Fair enough.

On their way out, they accepted helmets with laser-engraved red letters "R S S R" from the hands of Uglyov, a Robian - he was the first Robian to survive a space flight.

He was launched into space to check the technical readiness of the ship for the flight, which was then intended for live Mobians. In the minds of aviators who had survived the Great War, the Robotnik invasion, and the Civil War, space did not seem anything too frightening after these stories. There were no enemies in space, and the jolting inside the ship was not critical according to Uglyov's words. They had been instructed that their lives could be cut short, but subconsciously the aviation veterans treated it as just another training flight. \n\n"Blowdown...

From a safe distance, the astronauts videotaped the space colony ARK and even launched several small reconnaissance drones from the ship directly to the sinister and mysterious human legacy. Having successfully accomplished their mission, the "Avrora-1" crew landed 12 hours later at 33 kilometers north of Shilovograd, from where they were immediately sent to Stalegor, where even the Chairman greeted them with celebration.

There are reports that the Royal Army is already drawing troops to the border towns. Whether Elias is ready to wage war on three fronts, we cannot judge for sure, but if we act recklessly, the Royal Army will sweep us away in a matter of months. In regard to this, the General Staff has developed the War Plan Purple, which indicates the course of action to be taken against threats from the north. The adoption of this plan means that we must immediately launch an offensive against the Royal Army and break through to New Mobotropolis. Otherwise, we can negotiate with the King himself, relying on his reluctance to deal with us before the threats in the North. The third option - no diplomacy, no aggression, but we know what it may cost us ...".\n\nThe discussion filled the hall. From the beginning of the meeting to the end of the voting - a few hours, and they can determine much more than it seems at first. Is the the Southern Baronies' future to be an attempt to coexist peacefully with the North or a war to a victorious end?"

He silently pocketed the photo as he rested his hands behind his back and turned towards the balcony door. With a smile he put on his mask and opened the door, greeted by roaring crowds, cheers and celebrations for his power. In an equal display of it, Infinite raised his hand to silence the crowd and began to speak. \n\n"People of Jackalstan, I speak to you now in remembrance. The world we live in is cold and heartless, something we can work so hard to build can be taken from us unfairly and unjustly. You have all learnt this lesson as your former ruler took everything from you, for me it was the day my brothers in arms were slaughtered and betrayed by the corrupt bureaucrats of the United Federation. Today, we will honor their sacrifice! Remember as they gave everything to set me on the path to liberate you all from Kamil! From this day forward we will remember my former comrades!

Infinite approached the cowering Mobian, gesturing for his guards to leave the room. As soon as they locked the door behind themselves, Infinite stood up, removing the handgun he always kept in his poster and loading it. As the cowering Mobian before him expected nothing but death from him, the Jackal surprised him by tossing the handgun on the ground in front of him. \n\n“Go ahead, make the world a ‘better place’.” - commanded Infinite with a devilish smirk. With a pulse of adrenaline, the Dissenter grabbed the pistol, aimed it at the jackal’s forehead and fired.\n\nThe tyrant’s body became distorted and transparent as the bullet harmlessly passed through, small red pixel-like cubes appeared around his body as another Infinite materialized next to him, appearing to be surrounded by the same distortions as the first. Infinite cackled as the Dissenter kept firing, each bullet spawned more and more copies. They all marched towards him laughing in perfect unison. \n\n“You cannot kill us! We are more than Legion! We are INFINITE!” \n\nThe poor Mobian subjected to this cried out of fear and rage as they closed in, he looked down at the pistol in his hand and checked its ammo count. One bullet left. With tears flowing down his face, unable to bear the unkillable Jackal’s taunts, he held it up to his head, screamed as loud as he could and pulled the trigger. \n\nInfinite looked down at the corpse of his first test subject as the illusions vanished, he took the now empty handgun from his grip and wiped off the blood. When the guards returned to dispose of the body, Infinite looked at the glowing Ruby is his possession and smirked."

Raids from Jackalstan into Bharatsha were not unheard of, but nothing quite like this had been attempted before. The team’s explosives expert checked the detonator one last time as the noise of a large train approached them. Looking ahead they saw as it got closer and closer into position. The commander held up his hand, as they got ready to detonate the explosives. \n\n“Steady...steady…” \n\nThen the front cart was inches from the spot and the commander gave his orders, “Now! Blow that train sky high!” The commandos nodded as the detonator was activated, a loud explosion ripped the front car to shreds, sending its trains flying. The other boxcars quickly derail and fell to the sides sporadically. They slammed onto the ground, sending sand up into the air along with the guards. \n\nWith a smirk, the commander nodded for the commandos to move in as the snipers stayed behind. The few defenders that were not killed outright by the explosion or crash tried desperately to organize and fight back, a few even managed to fire upon the commandos. But they were either picked off by snipers or shot by the commandos. They approached one of the boxcars, shooting the lock off and opening it.

Each citizen had a bright happy smile on their face, many waved the flags of Jackalstan as a sign of patriotism.\nThe Corp members smiled and waved too at the crowds, basking in the glory they received. With bags slung over their shoulders, they stepped off the platform, at long last, their feet touched the warm concrete floor of Jacklstan rather than the cold prisoner camps of the RCSR. As they all waved and smiled, each of them made their way to an awaiting transport.\nAfter entering the door was closed and locked behind them as they were taken for some rest. While they were needed on the frontlines, it was clear they could all use some time to recuperate. They looked at each other, now they were more than a unit, they were survivors.

    inf.103.d:0 "The Bharatshian mathematician sat tied to a chair, a single dim light bulb illuminated the room. The chair he sat in was cold and uncomfortable, his bindings were tight, with the rough rope practically carving into his skin. He looked up at his captors, two Jackalstan soldiers, both glared at him like he’d eaten the last doughnut in the box but that doing so was an act of treason. He did not know what they wanted, he wasn’t a rebel or a traitor, the war was over. He just wanted to move on.\n"So, are you willing to comply and to answer our questions Mr. Knight?”\n“What the fuck do you want from me?! I’m a maths teacher for god’s sake, I work at the university, I have all the permissions and permits. What do you want to know?! How to learn Algebra?!”\n“No,” One of them grabbed a folder and opened it, showing Knight its contents. “Explain this. We found it searching your apartment, is this some kind of resistance code?!”\nKnight could not fault them for not understanding what was in the folder. To anyone who wasn’t trained, they’d think it was just some spy code or gibberish. But it was no such code, that would be easy to explain. No this was a formula.\n"That isn’t a code, that’s a formula!”\nThe two Jackals looked at each other, “A formula?”\n“Yeah, it’s a mathematical formula.”\n“For what exactly?! Calculating trajectories for missiles?! Or how to make explosives even bigger?!”\nKnight shook his head, “No. It’s about partitions”\n“And what are those?”\nKnight coughed loudly as he tried to speak, “Well...for example, there are five ways to add up the number 4. 1+1+1+1, 2+1+1, 3+1, 2+2 and 4. This means it has five partitions. With that formula, you can put in any number and you’ll get all the partitions.”\nThe two soldiers looked at each other, then back at him. “You came up with this? On your own?”\nHe shrugged, “More or less.”\nOne of the jackals immediately grabbed his radio, “Give me a minute.” He spoke into the radio, leaving the room as he did. The other soldier seemed amazed that such work could be figured out so effectively by someone from a conquered land.\n“Are you a genius or something?”\nKnight chuckled weakly, “I’m not quite that but...I have always been good with numbers.”\nThe other soldier entered, radio still in hand, “Could this formula be reworked to aid in other ways? Say...plug in a set of criteria for a number and figure out what it is?”\nHe thought for a minute before answering, he knew his answer could mean life or death. “I suppose, but not this exact formula. But perhaps something similar to it, reworking it would take time. Months if not years.”\nThe soldier nodded and spoke into his radio, “He says yes but it will take a while...are you sure?... Alright, I’ll let him know. Out.” He put away the radio and walked behind Knight, cutting off his bindings. The prisoner stretched his arms, rubbing his wrists as he sighed. It felt like bliss.\n"Thank you.”\n“Mr Knight…”"

Earlier that day he had received a message from the Capital, while the inspection of his troops was nothing new, the one who was leading it was. Infinite himself.\nHe wanted to leave a good first impression so he could perhaps be promoted. Before he could do one last quick check, the door opened. And he strode right in like he owned the place, which technically he did. The commander rose from his chair and offered Infinite a handshake.\n“Sir, it’s such an honour to-”\n“Your men.” He interrupted, “Where are they?”\nWith those words, the commander gulped nervously and gestured to the courtyard. “Right this way, I apologise if I seem nervous.”\nAs the pair behind to head outside, Infinite reassured him. “Do not worry. Such a reaction is natural.” The door opened and the pair stood atop a large balcony, looking down at the courtyard, where the soldiers stood. In rows and columns that would measure a perfectly straight line.\n“Now I hope that the reputation your men hold is accurate.”\n“Of course it is sir! Allow me to demonstrate.” He nodded at the men in the courtyard and they began their exercises.\nThe soldiers immediately began to demonstrate their skills. The first was with a simple marching drill, executed flawlessly with an also robotic level of precision. Already Infinite’s attention began to grow as he was curious as to how the rest of it would go. As part of the drills, they then performed a series of bayonet strikes and melee hits with their rifles. While they had no target in front of them, instead of hitting thin air, they were hitting the critical points of where their target would be. Following this, they all aimed their rifles over the shoulder of the comrades in front of them and opened fire. Each soldier maintained a stoic and serious face, a few of them blinked but that just meant there was room for improvement. Once their guns dried up, they turned to face the balcony and went into the ‘at ease’ stance.\nNow that his men’s demonstration was complete, the commander looked over at Infinite. “Well...what do you think sir?”\nInfinite stayed quiet for a second, before giving his response."

    inf.105.d:0 "The Jackal rested in his railway cart, after the completion of his conquest of Bharastsha he had decided to inspect the new land he’d ‘acquired’. The sunlight coated his body as he took a sip from the glass of whiskey he had in his possession. He let out a sigh, remembering his old comrades back when he worked for G.U.N. What he wouldn’t give for them to be here.\n“Sir?” Asked Keliska as the train began to grind to a halt. “We’re here.”\nInfinite nodded and stood up, heading over to the observation cart and looking through the glass into the town. It was a vast environment, the sunlight beautifully illuminated the architecture. Numerous temples, palaces and monasteries from forgotten chapters of Bharatshian history. Each one was pale white with large onion-like domes on the top, surrounded by numerous lakes and small gardens. Each tended to by monks and local volunteers.\n“Tell me about this place.”\nKeliska nodded and looked through her files. “The town is known as Chandaan, it was the capital of over 13 Bharatshian kingdoms in the past. Chandaan is largely intact due to the fighting having not reached here before capitulation and the lack of valuable strategic targets. While not the official capital following a series of bureaucratic reforms, it is still considered the cultural capital by much of the local population.”\nInfinite scratched his chin before saying coldly, “Preserve this place, but begin a brainwashing campaign to turn the ceremonies here into something more...useful.”\nThe Leader’s assistant nodded as the train left off to its next destination. The next town was less of a town, more of a ruin. The buildings were pitch black smouldering ruins, the roads were covered in more holes than a nice block of cheese. Wrecked cars, trucks and tanks littered the streets as bullet casings were as plentiful as rice. Infinite gestured for Keliska to give her report.\n“This is Gulkand. The town served as a major railway hub for the military, with a prominent supply depo and base nearby. The destruction is due to our bombardment and subsequent invasion of the local area. The locals have been...less than cooperative with our presence.”\n“Begin reconstruction, it should help improve our image. If not, begin reprisals.”\nKeliska made a note of this before the train moved on to its third and final destination. They arrived at a smog-filled industrial hellscape. Citizens walking down the street had to hear gas masks as their hands and clothes were covered in soot. The pollution was so strong that if you threw a javelin into the sky it’d probably get stuck. Blood was coughed up by the few who lacked gas masks as they tried to head into the almost vacuum sealed houses.\n“This is Dhania sir. A few decades ago, large deposits of natural resources were detected about 40 years ago, sparking a massive surge of industrial development. While this aided in Bharastsha’s industrialisation, it has also lead to a massive decrease in the standards of living in the local population-”\nInfinite raised a hand to silence Keliska, the concerns of these locals were below him. “Redirect 90% of industrial output towards projects in Jackalstan, the rest can be used to repair Gulkand. Of course, don't tell them that.” He gestured towards the locals.\nThe leader’s assistant nodded and made notes, scrubbing down the information as the train began to leave. For now..."

But he cared not, for his gaze was focused on the horizon.\nThere stood Bharatshan, the last of the resources they needed to fuel the nation’s war machine were within its borders. And now they would secure them. A chance to prove not just to the Federation, but the entire world that Jackalstan was not some backwater run by a mad dictator. It was a force to be reckoned with.\n“S...Sir?” One of the generals meekly spoke up, his entire body shaking in fear. Infinite’s guards stood ready to execute him if he spoke out of line. But the power hungry Jackal raised his hand, and his guards stood down.\n“Speak.” Infinite said stoically.\n“Everything is prepared, we are ready to strike on your order.”\nThe battle hardened leader looked out, taking in the atmosphere of peace one last time before giving his order.\n"

The Marshal lifted his head and looked through the veil at the candle that illuminated the desk, which had almost dried up. In its flame, he had visions of all the work he had done for his country and people, as well as the poisoned forests and the ruins of abandoned towns and villages. \n\n"Much has been experienced. Much has been done. Much remains to be done. This damned doctor has caused too much trouble for me not to relish the thought of his agonizing punishment for all his crimes, for all the suffering and destruction this psychopath brings with him. The scoundrel who seeks to turn all living things into cold steel, fulfilling his whims, has no place among the living. My only regret is that I will probably not be able to see retribution. There are more important things to do now. First, we must deal with them." \n\nHe looked away from the flames and signed the order. He leaned back in his chair and folded his arms across his chest and barely had time to close his tired eyes when the candle went out, but the marshal did not rush to replace it or move in any way. His countenance froze with his whole body, and the wool on his forehead was dampened with cold sweat. His breathing no longer echoed in the spacious office, nor did the heavy beats of his old heart come from beneath his uniform. \n\nThe smoke of an extinguished candle wafted through the ajar window of his study, where a full moon was shining through to illuminate the signed parchment and some of the text on it: \n\n"I - Marshal of Psarska, Wictor Drarzcowski, as the bearer of the executive power of the Psarska State hereby order: in case of my death, loss of capacity, or for other reasons that make it impossible to lead the country on my behalf, the rank, command of the army, representative, political and economic powers, to transfer and assign Jakub Drarzcowski as a candidate with all the necessary qualities for this position.
