### Modifiers ###
# The tags like: fighter_good, fighter_unique, etc may be anything, as they are not displayed in the game. If the tag is reused (say in DLC or MOD) it's entry is override with another one, not appended. So if want to append more modifiers in DLC or MOD make sure to give it a unique tag.
